      "This tremendous 100% varietal wine hails from Oakville and was aged over three years in oak. Juicy red-cherry fruit and a compelling hint of caramel greet the palate, framed by elegant, fine tannins and a subtle minty tone in the background. Balanced and rewarding from start to finish, it has years ahead of it to develop further nuance. Enjoy 2022–2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe aromas of fig, blackberry and cassis are softened and sweetened by a slathering of oaky chocolate and vanilla. This is full, layered, intense and cushioned on the palate, with rich flavors of chocolaty black fruits and baking spices. A toasty, everlasting finish is heady but ideally balanced. Drink through 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mac Watson honors the memory of a wine once made by his mother in this tremendously delicious, balanced and complex botrytised white. Dark gold in color, it layers toasted hazelnut, pear compote and orange peel flavors, reveling in the succulence of its 122 g/L of residual sugar.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This spent 20 months in 30% new French oak, and incorporates fruit from Ponzi's Aurora, Abetina and Madrona vineyards, among others. Aromatic, dense and toasty, it deftly blends aromas and flavors of toast, cigar box, blackberry, black cherry, coffee and graphite. Tannins are polished to a fine sheen, and frame a finish loaded with dark chocolate and espresso. Drink now through 2032.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the top wine from La Bégude, named after the highest point in the vineyard at 1200 feet. It has structure, density and considerable acidity that is still calming down. With 18 months in wood, the wine has developing an extra richness and concentration. Produced by the Tari family, formerly of Château Giscours in Margaux, it is a wine made for aging. Drink from 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deep, dense and pure from the opening bell, this Toro is a winner. Aromas of dark ripe black fruits are cool and moderately oaked. This feels massive on the palate but sensationally balanced. Flavors of blackberry, coffee, mocha and toasty oak finish spicy, smooth and heady. Drink this exemplary Toro through 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Slightly gritty black-fruit aromas include a sweet note of pastry along with a hint of prune. Wall-to-wall saturation ensures that all corners of one's mouth are covered. Flavors of blackberry, mocha and chocolate are highly impressive and expressive, while this settles nicely on a long finish. Drink now through 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lush cedary black-fruit aromas are luxe and offer notes of marzipan and vanilla. This bruiser is massive and tannic on the palate, but still lush and friendly. Chocolate is a key flavor, while baked berry and cassis flavors are hardly wallflowers. On the finish, this is tannic and deep as a sea trench. Drink this saturated black-colored Toro through 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This re-named vineyard was formerly bottled as deLancellotti. You'll find striking minerality underscoring chunky black fruits. Accents of citrus and graphite comingle, with exceptional midpalate concentration. This is a wine to cellar, though it is already quite enjoyable. Drink now through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The producer sources from two blocks of the vineyard for this wine—one at a high elevation, which contributes bright acidity. Crunchy cranberry, pomegranate and orange peel flavors surround silky, succulent layers of texture that present as fleshy fruit. That delicately lush flavor has considerable length.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Elegance, complexity and structure come together in this drop-dead gorgeous winethat ranks among Italy's greatest whites. It opens with sublime yellow spring flower, aromatic herb and orchard fruit scents. The creamy, delicious palate seamlessly combines juicy white peach, ripe pear and citrus flavors while white almond and savory mineral notes grace the lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From 18-year-old vines, this supple well-balanced effort blends flavors of mocha, cherry, vanilla and breakfast tea. Superbly integrated and delicious even at this early stage, this wine seems destined for a long and savory cellar life. Drink now through 2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A standout even in this terrific lineup of 2015 releases from Patricia Green, the Weber opens with a burst of cola and tobacco scents and accents. It continues, subtle and detailed, with flavors of oranges, vanilla, tea and milk chocolate discreetly threaded through ripe blackberry fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is in peak condition. The tannins and the secondary flavors dominate this ripe leather-textured wine. The fruit is all there as well: dried berries and hints of black-plum skins. It is a major wine right at the point of drinking with both the mature flavors and the fruit in the right balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With its sophisticated mix of mineral, acid and tart fruits, this seductive effort pleases from start to finish. Supple and dense, it's got strawberry, blueberry, plum and black cherry, a touch of chocolate, and that underlying streak of mineral. All these elements are in good proportion and finish with an appealing silky texture. It's delicious already, but give it another decade for full enjoyment. Drink now through 2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "First made in 2006, this succulent luscious Chardonnay is all about minerality. It's got a rich core of butterscotch and the seemingly endless layers of subtle flavors that biodynamic farming can bring. It spends 18 months on the lees prior to bottling. Drink now through 2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blockbuster, powerhouse of a wine suggests blueberry pie and chocolate as it opens in the glass. On the palate, it's smooth and seductively silky, offering complex cedar, peppercorn and peppery oak seasonings amidst its dense richness. It finishes with finesse and spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Nicely oaked blackberry, licorice, vanilla and charred aromas are smooth and sultry. This is an outstanding wine from an excellent year. Forward barrel-spice and mocha flavors adorn core blackberry and raspberry fruit, while this runs long and tastes vaguely chocolaty on the velvety finish. Enjoy this top-notch Tempranillo through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Coming from a seven-acre vineyard named after the dovecote on the property, this is a magnificent wine. Powered by both fruit tannins and the 28 months of new wood aging, it is darkly rich and with great concentration. As a sign of its pedigree, there is also elegance here, a restraint which is new to this wine. That makes it a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This fresh and lively medium-bodied wine is beautifully crafted, with cherry blossom aromas and tangy acidity. Layered and seductive, it offers a crisp mix of orange peel, cherry, pomegranate and baking spice flavors that are ready for the table or the cellar.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Heitz has made this stellar rosé from the rare Grignolino grape since 1961. Ruby grapefruit-red, it's sultry with strawberry, watermelon, orange zest and salty spice flavor, highlighted with vibrant floral aromas.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Alluring, complex and powerful aromas of grilled meat, berries, tea, smoke, vanilla and spice cover every base. An intense palate is concentrated but still elegant. Blackberry, molasses and mocha flavors finish with chocolaty oak notes, fine tannins and overall cohesion. Drink this special Rioja from 2020 through 2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tarry blackberry and cheesy oak aromas are appropriate for a wine of this size and magnitude. In the mouth, this Tinta de Toro is expansive and grabby, with bullish tannins. Slightly salty earthy accents come with core blackberry flavors and notes of baking spices and chocolate, while on the finish this is long, chocolaty, delicious and not too hard or tannic. Drink through 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The apogee of this ambitious winery's white wine efforts, this bottling of just two barrels of Clone 5 shows focused marzipan, marcona almond and white peach notes on the nose. The palate sizzles with saltiness and a lemony acidity that cuts through its brown butter richness with finesse. The finish is luxurious and long.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "San Jose-based producer Adam Comartin heads 1,100 feet up into the mountains to source fruit for this tremendous wine, which offers wild cherry, sage, and eucalyptus scents on the nose. Ripe black plum and strawberry fruit lead the palate, followed by acid-driven waves of juniper, pine and bay leaf, finishing with a menthol-like sensation.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Yields were down in 2015, but intensity is up, giving this medium-bodied, silky wine the potential to drink well through at least 2025. Hickory smoke outlines white peach before ending in a long flurry of lime zest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bergström has made a Shea designate since 2003, intent on showcasing a “pretty” style of the vineyard. Here are lovely aromatics, with grape jelly, rose petals and plum in the nose, and a complex run of red fruits in the mouth. Streaks of cola, brown sugar and more come up in a generous finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Focused and dense, this intense wine captures the essence of ripe raspberries. Aged in 50% new French oak, it's got a strong vein of coffee and mocha. The flavors broaden out and penetrate, finishing with highlights of cedar, cinnamon and dark chocolate. Drink now through the 2020s, but decant if you want the full expression.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cranberry, baked rhubarb, anise and crushed slate aromas show on the nose of this always-excellent bottling from the Franscioni family. The palate abounds with energy, driving black raspberry fruit accented with earthy loam, fennel, oregano and juniper through a compellingly round midpalate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This standout Rocks District wine brings earth shaking aromas of black-olive brine, tapenade, green olive, stargazer lilies, orange peel and crushed gravel. The smoked meat, charcuterie and blue-fruit flavors don't hold back, bringing a lovely sense of texture and detail. It's an intense wine that completely demands your attention.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Bulgarian Mavrud presents the nose with suggestions of dried cherry, black plum, freshly ground black pepper and a whiff of eucalyptus. In the mouth it is balanced with soft tannins mingling with dried cherry, cassis and black plum.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Steely and perfumed, this wine sees only 20% new French oak, remaining vibrantly fresh. Baked apple and lemon pith veer into grapefruit on the palate, with spiciness to the finish that's both brash and loud.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Underbrush, scorched earth, menthol and plum steeped in spirits are some of the aromas that unfold on the glass. The big, chewy palate doles out ripe wild cherry, raspberry jam, ground pepper and licorice alongside firm, velvety tannins. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pale in color, this is nutty in character, with a warm and rounded hint of red fruits. The wine has a soft, while still fresh, aftertaste. It is aged in cellars in Saumur on the Loire river.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas entice with notes of wet stone, honeysuckle, chamomile and stone fruit. The palate is generous in flavor and feel, showing a fine sense of balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Forest floor, tilled soil, mature berry and a whiff of new leather combine on this. The ripe palate offers fleshy black cherry, dried aromatic herb and tobacco, while fine-grained tannins give the finish some grip. Drink 2018–2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Gingery spice notes accent fresh pear and melon fruit in this medium- to full-bodied wine. It's round on the palate but not flabby, with a warm, spicy finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of forest floor, violet, red berry and a whiff of dark baking spice unfold in the glass while wild cherry, black raspberry, ground pepper and star anise drive the palate. Framed in firm, fine-grained tannins, this is a classic Tuscan red. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This has a charming nose that boasts rose, violet and red berry while the juicy, easy-drinking palate offers ripe wild cherry, chopped mint, white pepper and a hint of star anise. There isn't much complexity but it is savory and balanced, with fresh acidity and supple tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bright, savory wine delivers aromas and flavors of juicy wild cherry, black raspberry, violet, white pepper and mocha. Polished tannins provide the framework. Enjoy through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy plum and cherry aromas score points for being clear and direct. The palate on this varietal Mencía is round, smooth and just right. Lightly briny, earthy plum and cherry flavors hold steady on the finish, with a dash of saltiness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This comes across wide and expansive as it lazily exudes oily aromas of hazelnut and toffee. A plump palate is not overly cutting or demanding, while flavors of lightly salted nuts and buttered toast end with toffee and peanut flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an aromatic brooder with aromas of scorched earth, plum, dried flowers and green herbs. It's full in feel with dense, dark-fruit flavors, tightly coiled tannins and tart acids—a pleasing example of the variety.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of dark-skinned berry, rose and wild herb lead the nose. The round, juicy palate doles out ripe black cherry, fleshy raspberry, white pepper and clove while polished tannins provide a smooth, velvety framework. Enjoy through 2019.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a multiplicity of vineyards, this wine works and is a tremendous value for the price. It mixes hot mulled-cider spices, cinnamon, clove and pine forest, conveying surprising depth. Plum, dark cherry and more clove lead to a powerful, leathery finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The first Pinot Noir release from this producer, this is a velvety-smooth, exotic and charming wine, light on the palate despite a concentration of ripe, rich fruit. Kirsch, cherry, raspberry and cinnamon combine to make the wine invitingly lush and plush.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of brandied cherry and crème de cassis include a horsey sidenote and some heat. This sweet Monastrell smacks the palate with hard tannins. Flavors of black cherry, cassis and baked plum finish blocky.\n",

      "Quite dark in color, brooding aromas of olallieberry, blackberry, grape soda, plums and concentrated purple flowers appease the nose on this bottling from one of Paso's newly designated appellations. The palate blends licorice, turned earth and eucalyptus with a fresh pomegranate juice flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A nose of sour cherry and cranberry meshes with sandalwood and savory herbs on this single-site study by the longtime Paso producer. The palate is overflowing with oregano and other dried garden herbs, laid against a juicy red and purple-fruit frame.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Heavy fruit concentration meets thick, velvety tannins in this full-bodied, deeply colored and extremely flavorful wine. It's big enough to pair with big proteins, and concentrated enough to keep improving in the cellar. Best after 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cherry, plum, vanilla and mild oak aromas feed into a medium-bodied, elegant palate with plum and cherry flavors supported by a touch of toasty oak and vanilla. Notes of café mocha and toast grace a crisp finish that isn't trying too hard.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Attractive fruity tones of red currant, raspberry and strawberry hull dance in the bouquet of this pretty rosé, graced by garrigue accents of lavender and rosemary. Flavors of red berry skin and peach pit unfold on the medium-weight palate, framed by soft tannins and a delicate spice note that lingers on the close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lightly structured, this is a balanced, ripe wine. It has profited from the good vintage to offer strawberry, raspberry and citrus flavors that are well balanced and textured. Drink this attractive wine now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A sublime twist of citrus lies at the heart of this light yet complex white, which is refreshing and layered with a subtle bite of underlying oak. From a dry-farmed vineyard maintained by the same family for 30 years, this whole-cluster pressed wine was given time in a majority of stainless steel and neutral French oak. It shines in moderate acidity and tropical flair.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is tons of lively action packed into the nose of this wine, from rosebuds and zesty cherry cola to cinnamon spice and rainbow peppercorns. The texture is relatively light on the sip, and yet grippy tannins and a bursting acidity swim across the palate, showing vibrant iron and red-fruit flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Estate grown and aged in Stainless steel, this racy and pungent wine is packed with rich, juicy fruit flavors. Apple, lemon-lime and tangerine are in the mix, showing that Chardonnay does not always need oak flavors to have real power.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Clean, sharp and zesty fruit blossom aromas meet with ripe pomelo and green apple scents on the nose of this wine by Steve Dooley. A fresh, tingling acidity shows on the sip, which is a tad sour with stone fruit skins but bountiful in a slate-driven minerality and grippy texture. Cool climate Albariño has much promise in the state.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Red-cherry and strawberry aromas meld with rich fruit and warm baking-spice flavors to make this full-bodied wine hard to resist. The style is in the ripe, pastry shop mode, and soft tannins and acidity complete the picture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an exuberantly fruity, spicy and robust wine, speckled with 2% Petite Sirah. Dark and full of red berry flavor, the palate is dusted in brown sugar and black pepper. Ripe and concentrated, it drinks smooth and elegant despite its serious power.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of white flowers, stone fruits and lees are typical of well-made Albariño. A juicy, elegant palate with a mix of citrus and stone-fruit flavors is lasting, with a hint of pithy character coming up on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Quite vibrant and floral on the nose, this shows deep blackberry and both dried and fresh purple-flower elements as well as a baked berry pastry. The flavors are well integrated on the palate, where cooked blackberries in a vanilla pie crust combine with juicy strawberry, peppercorns and rosemary spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This most intriguing white grape, which the Larners grow as an ode to their Italian past, shows a sweet nose with a bone dry palate. Sugary citrus scents of orange blossoms and peach syrup give way to a brisk palate full of honeysuckle, night jasmine and a nearly pine needle bitterness that cuts dynamically through it all.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Reflecting the vintage, this Pinot is light and lithe in style. It shows tart cherry fruit and suggestions of chocolate, with bright acidity and a thin finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is a conversation starter, with its nose of mandarin orange, lemon peel and vanilla. On the palate, white flowers, citrus and lush tropical fruits mingle well. Pair with salmon and poultry.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dusty, leesy aromas of apple and vanilla are sturdy. This brut Cava is fresh and modestly elegant on the palate, with lime, apple and tarragon flavors. A dry, confident finish offers apple and citrus flavors and a sense of ease.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright aromas of citrus and tropical fruit give this easygoing white an easy appeal. Balanced and fresh, it's an elegant wine that will pair well with grilled fish and salads.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Peach, pear and lemon on the nose start this cheerful white from Alpha Estate. On the palate, it offers some complexity of exotic fruit and with a vein of acidity. Soft overall in profile, this wine is easygoing and enjoyable.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lightly herbal, horsey aromas of blueberry, black plum and cardamom are ripe by Carmenère standards. Hailing from a hot vintage, this is a bit flabby in feel, with soft tannins. Chunky plum and blackberry flavors finish with notes of licorice and mint along with a chewy, syrupy feel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This well-balanced, fruity wine allows space for some solid dry tannins that also show wood aging. Berry fruits shine through the structure to give a juicy character that is underlined by the fresh acidity at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In this fruit-forward vintage, it's not surprising to find that what shines here are the bright, spicy and tart flavors of strawberries, raspberries and cherries. The Sangiovese was co-fermented with 7% Syrah, and aged in 30% new American oak. As the wine breathes open the flavors of oak and char come up, and the tannins show some extra grip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of leather, roast plum and compost are challenging and not immediately inviting. In the mouth, this shows rubbery tannins and juicy acidity. Saucy, herbal plum and currant flavors ride on a beam of acidity toward an earthy, tomatoey finish with a lightly leafy aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Staunch berry, cassis and spice aromas are friendly and congruent. This Malbec-led blend is jammy in feel, a bit hollow in the middle, and easy to like as a whole. Blackberry and blueberry flavors finish fleshy, with soft tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Winemaker Billy Wathen blends 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc into this blend that's named after the U.S. Geologic Survey's name for Happy Canyon. A nose of dried oregano and thyme has a Bing cherry backdrop, with a palate of green peppers, blackberries and tomato leaf.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of fruit from three Rogue Valley sites, this is a fine example of the style of Pinot made in Southern Oregon. The estate vineyard sits at 2,100 feet on a steep, east-facing slope, with densely planted vines. It's a big, blocky, full-bodied wine, loaded with flavors of black cherry, black coffee and barrel toast. Tannins are substantial, but the flavors are full and forward. What it lacks in elegance it makes up for in immediate likeability.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dense, tarry aromas of asphalt and rubbery boysenberry are hefty but also a bit flat. This has a tannic mouthfeel to go with blackberry, prune and raisin flavors. Toast, bitter chocolate and full-bodied weight push the finish on this oaky, ripe Rioja. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This medium-bodied wine shows an array of smoky, meaty aromas, along with ripe plum and tart blackberry flavors. Not at all overripe, but made with some restraint, it allows savory flavors like tarragon and anise to peek through. The blend includes 9% Cabernet Sauvignon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The grape's usual peachy aromas show on this wine from regional pioneer Gary Eberle, along with lemon juice, honey and a touch of minerality. There is a nice mineral-driven tension on the palate, with flavors of apple and pear cider. It's a solid, down-the-middle take on the grape—not too ripe, not too thin.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tightly focused, as is often true of single-vineyard bottlings, this matches spicy berry fruit to light barrel flavors of milk chocolate. It's smooth and accessible, but finishes a bit short.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crushed plum, espresso, tobacco and cedar aromas unfold in the glass. A blend of 90% Merlot and 10% Alicante, the straightforward palate offers blackberries, red currants, clove and licorice alongside fine-grained tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of wild berries, violets and a whiff of spice lead the nose on this blend of Sangiovese and 15% Merlot. The savory, easygoing palate offers mature black cherry, clove and black pepper alongside lithe tannins. Drink through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Structured and firm, this is a dry wine with the potential of fine fruit in the future. Acidity cuts through the texture promising the freshness of black currants and berries. It's a perfumed wine that can still age. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This has a light yellow color with a touch of green and a subtle smell of crisp green apples. Flavors that are richer than expected, like poached pears, butter and fig. The texture is rich, the body full and the ripe flavors linger on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rhubarb, cola and pencil shavings emerge from the glass on this appellation blend from the longtime Santa Rosa Road winery, today owned by the Terlato family. Deeply earthy aromas of beet juice, root beer and dried berries arise on the palate, showing the region's typical blend of soil minerality and dark fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark, charred, lemony aromas of graphite, licorice and blackberry are horsey and baked. This blend of 85% Cab Sauv and 15% Cab Franc has an intense, blocky, pinching palate and heavy flavors of black fruits, resiny oak, spice and salt. A woody, tannic, raw feel to the finish creates a bumpy landing. Drink through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of leather, cherry and plum lead this balanced red from Boutari. Ripe cherry, cedar and cinnamon flavors carry the palate, with soft tannins giving a sultry feel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from what Californians call the Pommard clone, this has a light, traditional garnet color. Fresh and lively fruit aromas resemble cranberries and red cherries, followed by tangy fruit and cinnamon flavors of medium intensity, supported by firm acidity and moderate tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is aged in oak, but the vessels are large casks, or foudres, so the impact isn't that noticeable. The wine is meaty and savory on the nose, but the palate shows more herb-garrigue flavors and superripe cherry fruit. Drink now–2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pleasant red-fruit aromas of cherry and raspberry are low in octane for Toro. A fresh but not overly dense palate is lively and vital, with wild berry, plum and brown sugar flavors. A warm, heady, generous finish is fruity and bright. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here's a sleek Sangiovese that opens with scents of toasted oak, vanilla, blue flowers and mature plum. The round palate is already accessible, serving up sweet black cherry, black raspberry, licorice and mint framed in assertive but fine-grained tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A robust blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers aromas of baked plum, mocha, menthol and oak-driven spice. The hearty palate initially opens with black fruit, chocolate, licorice and dried herb flavors but the heat of evident alcohol dominates the finish and the close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Juicy and soft in blackberry and black cherry, this wine is nicely resolved in terms of tannin and oak structure,. These provide weight on the back palate, with enough heightened acidity on the finish to stay on balance. Strawberry and dried herb close things out.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of latex, tire rubber, spice, cured meat and berry fruits are rugged and require patience to sift through. This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is big and grabby, but not precise, with loud, herbal, muscular flavors of stewed plum, licorice and peppercorn.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Focused streaks of high-acidity lemon and a low oak profile combine for a refreshing take on Chardonnay, the other components coming together in swathes of fennel and brine. The wine finishes with a hit of power.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Oak aromas takes center stage with this wine by the Riboli family, with black cherry extract and a nearly Bourbon-barrel character on the nose. The rich, deep red fruit carries to the palate, which gains complexity from licorice and a tiny bit of tar.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Super earthy, in the classic damp forest-floor way, this also offers hints of menthol, eucalyptus and tomato leaf. The wine begins light bodied, but builds up power and weight as it goes. Layered with black cherry and plum, it's dark and savory.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Stainless-steel fermented and aged, this 100% varietal wine suggests kumquat, talc and wet stone. The flavor concentration is light with taut acidity the focus. It needs food; pair it with shellfish to see it shine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark, minty, inky aromas of blackberry are rugged. Same for the palate, which is pinched and rubbery, with grabby tannins. Flavors of toasted, blackened berry fruits are chocolaty and well oaked. Raw heat and minty, coffee flavors rev up the finish on this Malbec-led blend.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Merlot (57%) takes the lead on this lighter-colored wine that offers raspberries, cherries, herbs and woodspice. The fruit flavors are fresh and elegant, with lightly chalky tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a lush and powerful wine from a vineyard in the recently designated Paso Highlands district. Aromas suggest gingerbread topped with kirsch-soaked, chocolate-covered cherries. The palate is thick and heavy, with mocha, stewed plums, mashed cherries and black earth, which gain complexity from tannins and pencil lead.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hailing from the recently designated Paso Highlands subappellation, this hearty wine shows earthy aromas of nutmeg, iron, hot rocks, loam and cherry extract. It's lush and ripe with cassis and black cherry fruit, yet shows a more elegant chalkiness on the palate as well, rounded out by cocoa powder.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Apple, nectarine, lees and briny aromas steer this Godello toward a round, full palate. Slightly bitter flavors of melon and peach finish much like the wine starts—briny and leesy. This is also pithy tasting, like the inside of a grapefruit peel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Coffee grinds, raisin and baked aromas suggest overripeness. This is heavy, broad and a bit clumsy on the palate. Berry and prune flavors are solid but not overly fresh, while the finish is full and raisiny as it improves over time.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark-berry aromas are crisp and show a note of minerality as well as barrel char. This is firm, juicy and modest in structure, with flavors of blackberry and cassis touched up by some oak. A non-pushy finish with a hint of mocha is a good close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright fruit is allied to a more mineral structure to give a wine that shows the freshness of the vintage plus a more long-term view. It is cool with red fruits and some firm tannins that act as a background. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Owned by the Cruse family, one of the Bordeaux wine aristocracy, this rich wine is dominated by Merlot, giving it ample weight. The 18 months of wood aging shows in the smoky edge to the wine, although this will soften. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The smoky aroma and toasty wood character smothers the fruit. It is a tough wine at this stage although it does hint at some of the 2012 juicy fruit flavors. Drink this firm, solid wine from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intensely tannic, this structured wine has layers of wood aging, along with juicy fruits and bright acidity. There's a strongly smoky element, the wine's fruitiness balanced by a dark, toasty aftertaste. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a smoky, obviously wood-aged wine. The burnt toast character is still dominant, waiting for the attractive black currant fruits to catch up. It will develop into a bright, fruity wine, so wait until 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A creamy, buttery texture wraps around a core of bright lemon and apple flavors. This is balanced slightly toward sweetness as the luxurious viscosity carries the vivid flavors into the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This saignée-style wine is pale salmon in color, showing some bricking. It drinks dry with rounded suggestions of cherry and watermelon providing easy-drinking enjoyment.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Zesty and mineral, this unoaked, citrusy Chardonnay would make a particularly refreshing apéritif. Flavors of Asian pear and quince are crisp and cutting on the palate. Enjoy now for it's vivacious style.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoke and violet perfume are seductive on this elegant off-dry Riesling. Fresh green apple and pear flavors are tart but concentrated, wrapping up tightly with a squeaky-clean, lemon-lime finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intense notes of crushed stone and slate permeate this stately off-dry Riesling. Pert lemon and tangerine flavors are zippy and fresh, but the wine is more a showcase for its brisk, stony style.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Figs and spice perfume this tawny Cabernet Franc ice wine. It's a bit rustic in style, evoking layers of fallen leaves and potpourri melding with dusty raisins and figs. But it's elegantly crisp and the exotic, uniquely spicy character is seductive.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This ripe, now soft wine has gentle red fruits and soft acidity. It's ready to drink with its rich texture and smooth structure. The end is rounded, only just hinting at tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Owned by the same family as Château Talbot in Saint-Julien, this vintage of Sénéjac is now mature, showing signs of leather and a firm structure rather than fruit. It's unlikely to develop further, so drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an aromatic wine with notes of rose water, pear and white flowers. It drinks medium sweet with abundant spice flavors throughout. Pair with spicy Thai dishes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas of this wine suggest plum, herb and pencil eraser. It's full flavored with dark blue fruit and chalky, dry tannins. An affordable and approachable wine best enjoyed now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Though just four years old, this wine seems advanced with notes of dried cherry, vanilla, dried tobacco and blackberry. The dried cranberry and cherry flavors are rich and tart, backed by quite astringent tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tawny in color and wafting of potpourri and fallen leaves, this raspberry-inflected wine is already starting to show its maturity. Briskly concentrated and light on its feet, it makes an elegant sip to enjoy now before it loses its delicate, perfumed charms.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas on this wine are quite light, conveying wood, herbs and red fruit. This contrasts with the sweet, rich fruit flavors with a gentle grip of tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A mix of smoke and toast blends with fresh, crisp citrus aromas on the nose. That's followed by a foamy, reactive palate with flavors of pink grapefruit, orange, pepper and caramel. This remains foamy on the finish, which is peppery and slightly bitter in flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A big, ripe and spicy wine, this is packed with woody notes as well as powerful fruit. It has solid tannins and dark flavors of bitter chocolate and black cherries. It's rich and concentrated, with good aging potential. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blue flower, ripe berry, baking spice and mint aromas lead the nose on this full-bodied, elegant wine. The palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, licorice and mineral alongside firm, ripe tannins. It's young but already displays a great combination of structure and finesse.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is earthy darkness and a hint of the forest in this Zin, grown at high elevation in the rocky soils of the Rockpile appellation, these vines planted in 2001. The wine is magnificently structured with complex, ripe blackberry and cherry compote coming to the fore slowly and seductively.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crushed raspberry, blue flower, tilled soil and graphite aromas lead the nose on this firmly structured wine. It's still very young and needs to open up fully, but the palate already displays breeding and class. It offers ripe black cherry, ground black pepper, licorice and grilled sage alongside tightly wound but fine tannins. Drink 2018–2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The chalk soil of the Rosacker vineyard has produced a rich, intensely fruity wine that is shot through with steely minerality and a wonderful perfumed character. It's so crisp and fresh while also being densely textured and complex. The wine has a long future, drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Beautifully balanced, this conveys both rich fruit and a tense, intense minerality. Combining the two strands impeccably, it brings out tangy apple and pink grapefruit flavors and a steely, tight acidity. It's a structured wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tones of black cherry, toffee, tobacco, tar and violet show boldly on the nose and palate of this Moroccan red. Powerful tannins provide a suitable backdrop for fruit and spice flavors alongside an ever-present sense of brightness that lasts into the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intense aromas of dried rose, leather, truffle and crushed berry lead the nose. The ripe, forward palate offers crushed black cherry, wild raspberry, cinnamon white pepper and sage alongside chewy tannins. Drink 2015–2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Paradis is a parcel within the Pfingstberg Grand Cru, giving particularly fine and rich Riesling. This ripe and full-bodied wine manages to preserve all the elegance and style of the grape while having full tropical fruits, juicy acidity and a warm, rounded aftertaste. It will certainly age, so drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This late release, aging for five years, has produced a majestic wine. Its breadth of flavor, with ripe fruits as well as intense structure, are gently transitioning from the first flush of youth to a more mature character. Intensely textured, tight, ready to spring, it shows the beauty of maturing Riesling. Drink now, although it will age many more years.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Produced for Force Majeure by Syncline's James Mantone, this riveting wine is a blend of 47% Mourvèdre, 42% Syrah and 11% Grenache. Lush and redolent with wild berry and wet rock aromatics, it carries a thread of sweet grain along with bright, detailed berry fruit and balancing acidity. Delicious already, it can be enjoyed now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "More people would crave Mourvèdre if it were done in this style, with light rather than heavy leather scents alongside purple fruits. Once sipped, it hits the tastebuds with blueberry soda, tobacco, licorice, black pepper and wild game, all restrained and juicy rather than brooding and thick.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rounded, rich and full in the mouth, this offers swathes of flowery, aromatic fruit that is still young, still in its primary stage. With just a hint of steely texture, the wine does have structure and aging potential. For now, it is generous and delicious.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The winery's proprietary block of Zin grapes (planted in 1999) from the coveted Stagecoach Vineyards contributes to an intense wine. Juicy and oaky, it's dense in cherry and plum, a note of lavender and sage complementing the whole. A thick liqueur sense characterizes the texture, but the palate stays alive through the site's rocky minerality. This one'll age.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe and delicious, this starts off with aromas of fresh violet, rose, perfumed berry, exotic spice and tilled earth. It's still young but the palate already delivers a great depth of flavors including juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and black pepper alongside chewy tannins. Drink 2016 to 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From one of the many recent exceptional years in Sauternes, this ripe, unctuous wine has balanced the rich honeyed fruit and the drier edge of botrytis. It's full in the mouth, with Seville orange and a light touch of ginger. Drink from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A case study in cool-climate, estate-grown Syrah, the white pepper on the nose and palate is playful and exuberant, the acidity buoyant and lingering. The fruit takes on hushed tones of wild berry and bramble, with a soft texture inviting one in for more.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Chris Gorman is the winemaker for this pure, old vine Cabernet Sauvignon. Despite the high alcohol and the use of 100% new French oak, most of the old vine nuances are still there—a wild mix of heather and herb with berry and grain scents that weave together in the mouth. Brambly and tart, with strawberry and cherry fruit, it's a compelling wine that keeps you on your toes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Addictive aromas of hot blackberry pie laced with cinnamon, allspice, cola nut and a stewed cherry sauce reveal the promise of this popular Los Alamos Valley vineyard. Dark plum fruit, but with the acidity of the plum skin, meets with candied flavors of blackberry syrup and the freshness of soda water. A hedonistic Syrah.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Almost ready to drink, this wood-aged wine is packed with herbs, dark berry fruits and the first signs of secondary spice and leather flavors. The tannins are still powerful and need to soften further, so drink this complex, concentrated wine from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Somewhat light in color, this is an aromatically appealing wine that shows a complex assortment of coffee, vanilla, pencil lead, cherry, blueberry and high-toned herbal notes. It's exquisitely polished in its styling, with plush tannins and a long, lingering finish. A pretty expression of the variety that shows a great degree of elegance and deftness, it drinks well out of the gate but continues to improve with additional time to breathe.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a seven-acre section of the vineyard, this offers plenty of saddle leather and cedar amidst spicy cardamom layers, a soft, juicy core and tingling acidity. The structure and weight suggest the ability to cellar comfortably through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pure Petit Verdot from Red Mountain's quintessential Bordeaux varietal vineyard—does it get any better? Big, deep and tannic, with lovely purity, this features ultraripe fig and plum fruit with a pleasing salinity. The finish is persistent and shows a streak of iron. Note the alcohol is pushing 16% however it is beautifully integrated.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Principally Klipsun vineyard fruit, this is a mass of black cherry and cassis, wreathed in smoke from aging in 80% new French barrels. Great balance and length carry it through into drying tannins. A perfect steakhouse Cabernet.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Structured and energetic, this has a balsamic nose that offers aromas of menthol, mint, fennel, ripe berry, leather and a whiff of violet. The palate delivers crushed red cherry, black raspberry, baking spices and licorice alongside assertive tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2017–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This ripe, full wine has both great minerality and rich white fruits that are aromatic as well as very fresh. The fruits are laced with citrus to give a complex wine that deserves aging. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Floral aromas lead into a rich, not quite dry wine that is beautifully ripe and perfumed. It is rounded and opulent while preserving the steely, mineral texture. Still young, it demands aging. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "As its name implies, this wine comes from chalk soil, giving both a strongly mineral character and ripe tropical fruit flavors. It's rich, full in the mouth, dry but with such a ripe character there seems to be some sweetness. It's impressively full and ready to drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Produced from old vines, this is an impressive wine, rich and dense. It brings together dark tannins and opulent black fruits that cushion the firm structure. A lively acidity and a silky character show that the wine is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with a pretty fragrance of violet, exotic spice and perfumed berry. The juicy palate doles out ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, freshly ground pepper, mocha and anisette. It's nicely balanced with fresh acidity and firm but polished tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoky and toasty, this is a structured wine. It has layers of black currant fruits, fresh acidity as well as firm tannins that overlay the juicy fruitiness. It needs to age. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While the wine is rich, it's also very crisp and fruity. Tight acidity and a chalky, steely texture are balanced by ripe apples and pink grapefruit. It's a wine for drinking this year, bright and fruity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A tight and herbaceous wine that is crisp, mineral and fresh. It shows a great potential for fruitiness, with natural juicy acidity as well as a bright, aromatic aftertaste. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Round and velvet smooth, it has blackberry fruits that are full in the mouth, giving freshness while also making the wine rich and generous. The tannins are already well-integrated into this soft wine. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crisp and deliciously fruity, this is lively and bright. Acidity points up the lime and grapefruit flavors, leaving a fresh, juicy aftertaste. Drink now for maximum pleasure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full-bodied and resplendent in ripe apple and brioche, this well-crafted wine is layered and smooth. It would pair well with grilled salmon or herb-roasted chicken.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Toasty scents and flavors of the barrels (40% new) cloak tart raspberry fruit. It's clean and efficient, though for the moment at least, the barrel flavors outrun the rather light fruit. That can change over time, so give this one until 2015 or so in bottle.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This playful pink has fun aromas of cinnamon, red berry and bubble gum that lead to flavors of sour cherry and red plum on the palate. The finish is big, fruity and generous.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright orange juice, dill herbs and a slight whiff of vanilla bean lead the aromas on this un-oaked Chard. On the palate, flavors of apple cider come with a wash of fresh lime juice on the back end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This white combines 48% Roussanne with 35% Marsanne and 17% Viognier to creamy, tropical effect, its balance between ripe melon and pear fruitiness and spiced acidity well woven. From one of the few sources of some of these grapes in the Russian River Valley, this Rhône-inspired wine is ready to pair with lobster or a roast turkey dinner.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Taking time to come around aromatically, it opens up with plum and bright red cherry fruit that follow on the palate, a touch of savory tobacco suggested around the tannins. On the finish expect a balance of spice and sweet as black pepper and caramel compete for affection.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made for early drinking, this bright wine delivers red berry fruit lightly accented with sage and baking spices. It's not an ager so enjoy now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sourced from the estate vineyard—the same vineyard that fuels the Private Stash reserve—this shows a dusty, somewhat charred character, presumably from the barrel aging. Along with the slightly burnt toast character comes plenty of black cherry fruit, and acids that leave a slightly chalky impression in the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The other realm of the coin from Brown Ranch, Toyon is leaner and lighter, its color even subdued, a study in wild strawberry and layered floral highlights, oak and cardamom spice. It bristles with acidity, pleasant to sip on its own or with bacon-wrapped figs.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a frizzante style of Muscat, the pressure slight enough to allow for a screwcap seal. Off-dry, spicy and aromatic, it's a great sipping wine, with concentrated flavors of sweet orange-pekoe tea.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with aromas of black plum, oak, espresso, black pepper, balsamic notes and a whiff of barnyard. The bracing palate delivers crushed dark cherry alongside oak sensations of espresso, toast and vanilla. Aggressive wood tannins cut this short and give an astringent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The winery's signature widely distributed white is heady in flowery jasmine, with vibrant acidity and a sense of sweetness on the palate thanks to fresh fruit flavors of grapefruit, peach and nectarine. An ideal wine for summer or whenever one needs to recall a summer's day.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smells of rust, iron, tomato and untracked peppercorns rise to the nose. On the palate, the wine is quite light and racy, with a little boysenberry and more sanguine flavors. Hold onto this one until 2016 for maximum enjoyment, as more flavors will emerge.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Black plum, chocolate-covered cherry and mocha sensations come together alongside forceful tannins. It's rather ripe and forward for the vintage. Drink 2018–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is brilliantly purple in color, with jumpy, untamed black-fruit aromas. In the mouth, it is tannic and clawing, with a cheek-drilling mouthfeel. Syrupy blackberry flavors offer baking spice and clove accents, while the finish is showing unabsorbed oak and monster tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dusty black cherry and dark plum aromas are ripe and friendly. This is a plump, modern-style red with a clean mouthfeel and weight. Berry fruits, spice and oak flavors blend well, while the finish is, in general, full, smooth and adequately fresh. Tempranillo with 10% Petit Verdot.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This fresh and fruity sparkling wine is crisp with apple skin and apricot flavors. Ripe and full in the mouth , it has a lightly creamy mousse. The blend of Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay gives delicious fruitiness and tight final acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Chalky earth, black pepper and clove comprise the nose on this wine, which gets a boost from 10% Merlot. The flavors are spicy and complex, with cedar, tea and a tiny bit of varietally distinct green pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Oso Libre ventures into the nonvintage category with this blend of 10 wines from the past five years, delivering a nose with blackberry and a pinch of pepper. The meaty wine really gets your attention once sipped, with boysenberry, cracked peppercorn, some iron and a lingering licorice flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from vineyards throughout the village of Serralunga d'Alba, this straightforward wine is still closed. It reveals black cherry, espresso, prune and subtle oak alongside a note of tire rubber. It's still extremely young, with aggressive tannins that dry out the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A lemon-scented, crisp wine, it's also full of ripe yellow fruits. It's a warm in style, rich with both fruit and an open texture. Almonds and acidity give a refreshing aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a great sunny day wine, starting with aromas of honeydew melon, ripe nectarine and lemongrass. There is a slightly peachy, bubblegum character once sipped, with lemon-lime soda in the midpalate and a flinty, gunmetal finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A brighter, more mineral- and acid-driven take on the often rustic Rhône grape, this kicks off with fresh smells of raspberry and rock. The palate brings tart cherry, followed by just-ripe black berry and really ripe raspberry on the midpalate, and a tartness on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a lot happening on nose of this wine from Sta. Rita Hills pioneer Richard Sanford's recently rejuvenated Alma Rosa label. Aromas suggest light butterscotch, baked pear, fresh pluot and jasmine. Once sipped, the flavors don't live up to the aromatic promise, but apple, pear and a sharper tangerine rind round out the flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Immediately this smells raisiny, but with time secondary scents of cinnamon and Middle Eastern spices come into play. The body is soft and extracted, with modest acidity. Flavors of baked black fruits, fig paste, chocolate and herbs follow the nose, as does a chocolaty, rich  finish. Drink through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Packed with tannin, it is not showing much sign of fruit yet. It is dark, brooding and very firm in texture, with just with a hint of juicy black cherry flavors. Wait until 2017 before drinking.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A very fruity wine, it shows rich wood flavors as well as equally rich fruit. It is complex, very mineral in character, tight and nervy. The citrus fruit is matched by the apricot flavor, putting down layers of acidity. Don't drink before 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The southern Napa Coombsville area is near San Pablo Bay, making it a cool area. In this vintage, it shows the acidity and mineraity of its terroir, but also the ripeness Chardonnay can achieve in a good vineyard, with orange and apricot flavors enhanced with oak. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the estimable Shake Ridge Ranch, winemaker Rosemary Cakebread has fashioned a lovely blend from 53% Grenache, 31% Syrah, 14% Mourvèdre and 2% Viognier. Opening with leathery tannins, the rich and savory concoction imparts juicy dark plum, tobacco and especially coffee.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The vintage was a great one not only for J's dry table wines but for its sparklers. This brut, a classic Chardonnay and Pinot blend, with a drop of Pinot Meunier, is dry, with complex lemon, orange, yeast, vanilla, cream and toast flavors. The bubbles are ultra-fine, raising the appeal.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is such a good Pinot, and so reflective of the Sonoma Coast, that its price makes it a steal. With low alcohol and brisk acidity, it's translucent in color, with a gleaming ruby hue. The mouthfeel is silky and delicate, yet the raspberry, cola and buttered cinnamon toast flavors are intense. Drink now–2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine has more structure and depth than most Pinot Biancos from Alto Adige, thanks to vineyard location and 20% aging in large casks. It delivers sensations of apples and exotic fruit along with a flinty note. The creamy texture is brightened by lively acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pure Alvarinho from the Monção region, it's rich, creamy and textured. Lined with great acidity, it also has intense apple, bitter orange and a strongly herbal element. While it's ready to drink, this complex wine will benefit by waiting until 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wood-aged wine comes from a small parcel of old vines in the Quinta Nova vineyard. With its ripe, smooth and creamy texture, it has a full, almost Burgundian feel. Ripe peach combines with vanilla to make a wine that has concentration and richness, cut with final acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A great follow-up to the winery's 2011, made this time from an esteemed vineyard in one of the coldest parts of the valley. The vintage was difficult, but the wine is rich in raspberry, cranberry and persimmon flavors, brightened by crisp acidity and finishing totally dry. There's no reason not to drink it now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here's a delicious Soave with depth and character. Floral aromas of Spanish Broom and chamomile take center stage, accented by a smidge of exotic fruit and graphite. The juicy palate offers honeydew melon, white peach, ripe pear, citrus and mineral purity balanced by fresh acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Classic varietal aromas include stone fruit, crushed tomato vine, freshly cut grass and green melon. The palate offers a depth of flavors that include creamy white peach and ripe cantaloupe that are brightened by firm acidity. It closes on a flinty mineral note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The estate wine from Château du Cèdre is anything but simple. A powerful series of tannins and dense black fruits offer both a dark texture and great fruitiness. Acidity comes through strongly and, with the tannins, promises aging. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The minty aromas indicate new wood aging as well as a ripe, polished texture. They make for a wine that has presence and structure as well as rich fruitiness, blackberry flavors and a dry, solid core. It's a sophisticated wine that can age. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from 100% Cabernet, this wine shows the intensity of fruit that Mount Veeder is capable of expressing. It also has excellent acidity. But the tannins are astringently strong, giving a numbing sting to the palate. This certainly needs time. Give it until 2022 and beyond.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Right out of the bottle, this 100% Syrah delights for its overall balance and deep, rich array of cherries and blueberries. If you pay attention, you'll find more complex layers of sautéed wild mushrooms, grilled prosciutto and toast. Dry and tannic, and would be ideal with roasted lamb.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is a great balance here between the creamy fruit and the wood flavors. Apricots, ripe apples and melon are spiced with the right amount of toastiness. The wine has a rich, warm feel. It is still young, so wait until 2015 to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hugely tannic at this stage, this dense and complex wine has great structure partnered with dark black fruit and licorice. There is forward bitterness, suggesting this wine needs aging. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a ripe and smoothly textured wine. It is already finely balanced, rich with toast, apricot fruits and a tight, mineral character. It is enjoyable now but will age well until 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sourced from a 15-acre vineyard on Parrett Mountain, this displays single vineyard specificity. Entry is surprisingly soft, and (perhaps influenced by the name) there seems to be a pleasing clay-like quality to the mouthfeel. Clean blueberry fruit leads into a tasty, balanced finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Still firm and closed, this is a structured wine, solidly tannic with just hints of fruit. It has a dry feel to it, firm, the acidity and red fruits coming through the leathery, dark texture. The wine needs aging, so drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Violets, truffles and ripe black fruits are present in this structured wine. It has almost too much richness, but there is plenty to admire. Solid tannins, a dark, heavy texture and complex acidity all show aging potential. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sourced from the Chalice (estate) vineyard, this aromatic and seductive wine presents a compelling mix of tree fruits, racy acidity, and a rich, textural, open mouthfeel. The flavors of pears, orange peel and snappy spices linger deliciously through a long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a gigantic Syrah, a tsunami of blackberry jam and milk chocolate, with headier notes of cassis liqueur and toasty buttered oak. That sounds sweet, but the wine is thoroughly dry. The tannins are thick, but finely ground and negotiable now. It might last in the bottle for many years, but there's no point in aging it. Enjoy now with elaborate roasts and stews.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A ripe, wood-aged wine, it's richly smoky and fruity at the same time. The blend brings out honey, ripe apricots and peach. Acidity cuts through at the end to give a final, delicious lift. Drink now, but best wait until 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The hue is an elegant peach just starting to blush with pink. The wine is entirely dry, with low alcohol framing intricate flavors of peaches, limes and vanilla, brightened by crisp acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A savory Sauvignon with intensity and balance, it has aromas of cantaloupe and crushed tomato vine. The vibrant palate offers juicy green melon, pineapple and citrus together with a mineral note. Fresh acidity leaves a clean, crisp finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This savory Pinot Grigio has a little weight on it thanks to grape selection and 20% aging in large barrels. It delivers classic Granny Smith apple, Bartlett pear, nutmeg and flint in a creamy texture brightened by fresh acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With a light, silky mouthfeel and mouthwatering acidity, this Pinot satisfies for its rich array of raspberries, cherries, spices, cola and smoky oak. It defines the Carneros style: tart, a little earthy and ageworthy. Drink now–2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "De Loach continues to impress with this Lake County vineyard-designate, a well-balanced Zin with plenty of density amid its brick tar and brambly blackberry fruit. With leveled acidity along with plenty of power, it'll both age and be pleasing to drink now, with smoky meats.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This standout Rocks District wine brings earth shaking aromas of black-olive brine, tapenade, green olive, stargazer lilies, orange peel and crushed gravel. The smoked meat, charcuterie and blue-fruit flavors don't hold back, bringing a lovely sense of texture and detail. It's an intense wine that completely demands your attention.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Entirely estate grown from dry-farmed grapes, this white sparkles with waxy apricot and pear flavors and crisp, underlying mineral stoniness. Dry, with refreshing acidity, it doesn't skimp on mouthfeel, delivering a viscosity that's invitingly complex and lingering.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This complex and fragrant wine opens with dried violet, black plum and cooking spice aromas. The smooth, well-structured palate doles out blackberry jam, pipe tobacco, ripe black cherry, nutmeg and licorice flavors. Velvety tannins provide elegant support. Drink through 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a combination of dry-farmed estate fruit and grapes sourced in Carneros, this lovely white is fermented in stainless steel, which coaxes a seamless, light-bodied crispness on the palate. Exotic white peach and briny stone highlight a heady aromatic thread of honeysuckle, ginger and wild vanilla.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Winemaker Bill Brosseau hits a single vineyard home run with this bottling from one of the Central Coast's oldest sites. It shows exotic plum, tangy cranberry, pine needle, juniper and pencil shaving scents on the nose. The palate is steeped in mulberry, marjoram and curry-like Indian spices, proving dynamic and delicious in the most compelling ways.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Yields were down in 2015, but intensity is up, giving this medium-bodied, silky wine the potential to drink well through at least 2025. Hickory smoke outlines white peach before ending in a long flurry of lime zest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The estate's 13 acres were first planted in 1999. This lovely wine expresses itself with perfectly ripened black-cherry fruit, a dash of cola, and an underpinning of clean earth, complemented with a touch of mineral. The finish is superb.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Consistently outstanding Pinot Noir producer Black Kite has done it again. This bottling comes together in a seamless symphony of aromas and flavors. Ripe fruit, subtly spicy oak and forest floor notes fill the glass. Its opulent texture unfolds into layers of baking spice, earthiness, and red and black cherry fruit, with a long, complex finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Powerful tannin meets subdued fruit in this layered, youthful wine. Concentrated and focused, with rose petal, sage and wild strawberry notes, it holds back teasingly before slowly unraveling to reveal velvety texture and corpulent weight.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is a darker fruit spectrum evident in the reserve, with notes of coffee, smoke, black fruits, a touch of charred wood all worked through, and without damping the core fruit flavors. Those bright flavors spotlight raspberry, plum and black cherry. A light cola flavor pokes through, with ripe tannins and proportionate acids. The barrel treatment is beautifully applied, adding sweet spice to the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the famous site on Westside Road outside of Healdsburg, this bold red shows orange, dark cherry and pungent earth scents, remaining savory at its core. Medium-bodied and balanced with acidity, it takes on a meaty persona seasoned with pepper, clove and black tea.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Elegant and savory, this vibrant white offers enticing Spanish broom, yellow stone fruit, wet stone and crushed thyme aromas. The vibrant, ethereal palate carries subtle, tantalizing layers of yellow peach, tangy tangerine, lemon drop and pineapple with lively acidity. A graphite note closes the lingering finish. Too elegant for some palates, it shows impressive balance and depth, despite the cool, wet vintage.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hands down one of Italy's best whites, this boasts alluring white flower and yellow stone fruit scents. The enveloping, delicious palate delivers white peach, mature pear, ginger and lemon drop flavors. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors while a mineral note energizes the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This impressive 100% varietal wine shows focused red fruit, a tropical edge of coconut and firm, structured tannin. Sage, cedar, tobacco and black pepper notes provide a sultry, savory counterpoint to the fruit, balanced with moderate acidity. Enjoy 2023–2033.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This gorgeous wine deftly integrates a lively mix of currant, cherry, breakfast tea and dried leaves into a seamless and seductive whole. Produced from vines dating back to the early 1970s, it finishes with a delicious streak of milk chocolate. Drink now through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a prime site relatively high in elevation for the appellation, this wine shows beautiful, crisp acidity, as robust layers of mountain raspberry, blackberry and coffee flavor vie for attention. Full bodied and densely structured, it unfurls in wisps of black licorice and clove on the lengthy finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This pretty, floral wine made entirely from Chardonnay grapes from this site is both creamy and crisp. It offers impressive length, acidity and stoniness, accenting its focused green apple flavor. As it opens, it takes on a richer honey-like tone that adds further complexity and deliciousness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intensely aromatic, yet big and even chunky in the mouth, this young wine remains compressed and hard-edged. Give it ample aeration, and cranberry, blackberry and black cherry fruits come alive. Dense with fruit and detailed with wet stone minerality, this should be cellared a few years, and consumed from 2020 to 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine comes from the grand showpiece estate of Madiran. A blend that is dominated by Tannat produces a wine that is still so young. Bold fruits and firm tannins are right to the fore, along with acidity and a strong mineral texture. It's a powerful and impressive wine that also manages elegance as well. The wine will take several more years to soften. Drink from 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas pop, with notes of orange peel, ember, cured meat, black olive and wet stone, with purple fruit lurking in the background. The palate is surprisingly fruit forward, with plum and savory flavors that coat the palate from end to end. The finish glides for a full 30 seconds.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a wine that is beginning to show some fine maturity. There are ripe fruits still very present, but they are matched by the secondary flavors, spice and warm tannins along with the classic herbal character of Mourvèdre. The wine is produced from organically grown grapes, giving purity as well as some serious structure in the background. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spicy yet sweet aromas of sarsaparilla root, saddle leather and earthy berry fruits precede a rich dense palate. This tastes of dark cherry and berry fruit, with an herbal shading adding complexity. Chocolaty oak takes hold on a solid long finish. Drink through 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is one of the classics among Provence rosés. Produced from organically grown grapes and coming from an impressive red-wine producing estate east of Aix-en-Provence, the wine is structured and ageworthy with its blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon. Rich and full of red fruits, the wine should be drunk from late 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe pure black-fruit aromas are touched up by notes of malty chocolate and mocha. This is proportionally big, with cheek-grabbing tannins, but it's not overly hard or unbalanced— just the opposite. Flavors of mocha, coffee, hazelnut and ripe berry fruits finish flush, dense and firm, with toasty notes and powerful but controlled residual tannins. Drink through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This single-vineyard estate wine is made by Nils Venge and Tom Rinaldi, who have somehow managed to capture quiet elegance and powerful fruit at the same time. Red-fruit driven, it's round and rich, with moderate tannin and cassis, clove and black pepper highlights.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an impressively rich, still very young wine. Dominated by Bandol's own Mourvèdre grape, it is dense and concentrated. Spice and dark red fruits are shot through with a wonderful herbal character that conjures the southern warmth. The wine is still just setting out and will not be ready to drink before 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Open-grain oak aromas are out front, followed by sweeter scents of marzipan, prune and chocolate. A full, tannic palate is deep and dense, while toasty blackened flavors of cassis and blackberry finish with notes of mocha, chocolate and pepper. This is a bit rough and tannic, so cellaring will help it calm down. Drink through 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a serious wine with a lighter brighter side. Its wood aging adds spice to the ripe red fruits and brings out the concentration and intensity. It is, in its way, an unexpected side of Provence rosé, emphasizing richness and complexity. But it all comes together: a fine wine that, after a year of aging, is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From old vines in a tree-enclosed vineyard on the third terrace above the River Lot, this wine forms part of a range of wines featuring the soils and terraces of the Cahors vineyard. Named in homage to Marguerite de Massaut, a 16th-century owner of the estate, the wine is aged in new wood that gives it a minty character. That is balanced by the rich black-plum and truffle flavor and the intense acidity. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Polished in every way, this brings an enticing potpourri of almond paste, apple and white pepper. Wild yeast fermentation in oak (30% new) marries complex components in perfect precise balance. As with all the Ponzi 2014 Chardonnays, the acids are bright but not biting, and the wines are built for both near-term enjoyment and medium-term aging.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Scents of woodland berry, rose petal, grilled herb, anisette and a balsamic note emerge on this firmly structured wine. On the robust palate, white pepper, licorice, sage and a hint of toast weave through the black cherry core. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the close. Drink 2018–2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Juicy, sun-kissed grapefruits and apple blossoms explode from this buoyantly fresh, off-dry Kabinett. Invigorating acidity lends backbone and a steely focus that resonates long on the finish. It's beautiful now, but should hold nicely, and perhaps improve, through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dense, rich red fruit belies an elegant wine that finds balance despite the concentration of vanilla and berry. Soft, approachable and integrated tannin and oak let the whole exist as one, instead of separate parts. This shows off the appellation's mountain fruit and rocky minerality.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lightly leesy aromas of vanilla cookie are offset by crisp minerally apple and stone-fruit scents. This is pure and lifted by fine acidity, while flavors of apple, pineapple and lemon-lime end fresh, with a distant note of citrus pith. Drink immediately.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the Lovall Valley section of the Napa Valley quite near Sonoma, this lovely wine is awash in tropical mango, with lilts of pear and vanilla. Creamy, it's made in a fuller-bodied style but never gets ridiculous, instead offering balance and elegance, finishing with a squeeze of grapefruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The top wine in the Rocim range is produced from selected Alicante Bouschet grapes. It is huge and powerful, perhaps too much in its concentration, richness and density. Dark and brooding, it is super everything and certainly needs to calm down. Drink from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a cantaloupe-like ripeness on the nose of this blend of 37% Grenache Blanc, 33% Viognier and 30% Roussanne, but not overdone, layered with seared white peach, caramelized pear, poached apple and almond aromas. The palate is more restrained and quite grippy, with flavors of green-apple skins, Bosc pear and a touch of honey.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This lush offering opens with appealing aromas of rose petals and fresh strawberries, then glides into a smooth-as-silk midpalate. The berry/cherry fruit is nicely adorned with toasty barrel flavors, and it's as satiny as new sheets. You'll find it hard to keep from gulping this by the glassful.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A pretty salmon-pink in color, and a lovable quaffer, this wine is dry, crisp and brightly refreshing in succulent waves of grapefruit and tangerine, remarkably light in alcohol but not shy in flavor. Enjoy it on its own or with a range of foods—its lightness begets versatility.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of slightly stewed fruit, steeped berry, spice and menthol unfold in the glass. The firm palate delivers juicy cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, ground pepper and a mint note while bracing tannins and racy acidity provide the backbone. This needs a few more years to calm down and will continue to age well for a decade or more. Drink 2018–2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pretty aromas of blue flower, rose, wild berry and graphite lead the way. The firm palate delivers mature black cherry, raspberry, star anise, black pepper and chopped sage alongside bright acidity and tightly knit tannins that need to unwind. Drink 2018–2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bittersweet at first, with sizable tannins, this Cab also contains 13.8% Petit Verdot. Red and black berries give it a juicy palate atop dusty, chalky tannins and a richness of leather and clove on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of perfumed berry, mint, baking spice and a whiff of oak emerge on this structured wine. The firm palate offers wild red cherry, crushed raspberry, mint, grilled sage and a touch of oak-driven spice alongside bracing tannins and nervous acidity. Give it time to soften and fully develop. Drink 2019–2031.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas and flavors of sandalwood and grenadine layer around this velvety, seductive wine. It offers black tea, truffle and forest floor, the body sinewy and complex. Savory in cinnamon and clove on the finish, it needs more time to open; decant or cellar through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A classic northern Rhône valley blend of Syrah with a touch of Viognier, this massive wine is made from grapes grown on granite soil, which leaves its mark in dense minerality and great power. It is a wine for lovers of the big stuff, concentrated and needing to age. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a rich, full-bodied wine that is ready to drink now. It still has a dry core of tannins, although they are overwhelmed by the rich, juicy black fruits and generous texture. It's a concentrated wine, high in alcohol, although that is really balanced by the fresh aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Warm vanilla notes are laid across ripe nectarine, apple skin and a twist of lemon rind on this single-vineyard study by the Los Gatos-based winery. Pencil lead kicks off the palate, which then opens into poached apples and lemon oil, laid across a sizzling acidity that lasts long.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lemony and light on entry, this tropically kissed, textured white develops body and weight over time, finding a balance and elegance that's hard to ignore. A touch of white peach wraps up the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Often herbal and a bit green in nature, Silvaner is a much maligned grape. Yet at Thörle, it seems to blossom into something perfumed and quite fruity, redolent of peaches and fresh pears. Characteristic herb notes are fresh and nuanced, highlighted against brisk citrus and apple flavors and a silken supple mouthfeel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Engaging aromas of red rose, iris, wild berry, cinnamon and a balsamic note waft out of the glass while juicy cherry, white pepper, anise and chopped mint drive the spicy, polished palate. Firm but refined tannins provide structure. Drink 2017–2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Caramelized white peach, salted lemon, pear skin, red apple and the hint of white flowers show on the nose of this wine by these longtime but under-the-radar producers. The palate blends orange skins and grapefruit pith with buttered toast, sea salt and a dill-like herb character.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A limited, popular entry in Winderlea's extensive single-vineyard lineup, this suggests cherry kirsch with streaks of coffee and tobacco. The pretty fruit leads into darker notes of tar and espresso. Still young and primary, the Juliard may be among the vintage's most long-lasting wines.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a very lively wine with a creamy mousse. The wine is towards dry, bringing out great white and citrus fruit flavors with a burst of tangy acidity. It comes from the village of Chouilly in the Côte des Blancs, which gives the wine a tight mineral texture at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A Garrafeira wine is a special selection and this wine, which was aged for 30 months after bottling before being released, shows its quality quickly. Now reaching drinkability, its tannins have softened leaving rich full black currant and fresh acidity along with a more mature leathery character. Drink now and until 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Principally Pinot Noir, the blend includes 25% Pinot Meunier and a splash of Chardonnay. It's a light and pretty salmon pink in hue, with hints of honeysuckle and moist earth in the nose. Flavors suggest tart raspberries and Bing cherries, with impressive minerality in the crisp, lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Restrained aromas of black plum barely set the stage for flavors of dark plum, cherry-vanilla, mint eucalyptus and ground black pepper. Fruit flavors are soft, but the minty notes never overpower brightness and acidity. Tannins are just shy of opulent, and the finish is marked by a note of tart apple crispness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Creamy on the nose, this wine shows seared pineapple, apple custard, lemon oil and faint iodine aromas. The flavors are evenly placed between lemon yogurt and salted apples, mixing a bit of tang and ripe fruit with a savory sea salt.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lush aromatics conjure up dreams of strawberry cream. This is quite pretty, with perfect balance among its components of fruit, acid and tannin, set comfortably in a compact frame.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Enticing aromas of crushed rose, red berry, wild mint, menthol and a hint of oak come together. The linear, focused palate offers raw red cherry, strawberry, white pepper, licorice and chopped sage accompanied by tightly knit, close-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2019–2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe berry aromas blend nicely with earthy leathery scents. With a full and easy palate, this generous Crianza delivers blackberry and chocolate flavors that veer toward raisin and prune, especially on the finish, which is lightly toasted and dense in feel. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cedar, cherry, black olive, wet earth, green olive and freshly plucked plum pop on the nose of this bottling. The palate shows lots of ripe black cherry down the middle, but is surrounded by a tangy green olive and an underripe-berry character, whose tartness enlivens the mouth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "One of the few in California to use this grape, winemaker Ryan Pease makes a great case for more in this bottling, which shows broad lemon curd, soft apple flesh and Anjou pear on the nose. There is ripe stone fruit on the tangy palate, but it's bone dry and grippy with chalky texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Much like its companion from the Revelation & Sorek Bloc, this offers well-endowed flavors of melon and white peach, along with a touch of citrus. There is a sense of higher acidity, along with lower listed alcohol, rather counter-intuitive as this is the reserve. Pick either one and you'll be pleased.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Pinot-ness of this wine is undeniable: its structure is of velvet, and its aromas convey freshly turned earth, autumnal oak leaf and subdued red-cherry fruit. There is a depth that evokes deep forests. Have this with furred or feathered game.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a blend from most parts of the village, with fruit from 14 different parcels. It is solid and firm while also having great swathes of raspberries and red plums laced together with acidity. The aftertaste is perfumed with a fresh lift. Drink from 2018\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This new sister label from Elk Cove offers 100% Willamette Valley Pinot Noir at an everyday price. Fresh cranberry and raspberry fruit is framed by herb-tinged tannins. The immaculate craftsmanship and clean direct flavors are light years beyond budget Pinot Noir from most other regions. This is your perfect salmon wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Red berry, rose and clove are some of the aromas you'll find on this bright, supple red. The smooth palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed strawberry and white pepper alongside fresh acidity. A mineral vein underscores the savory flavors and energizes the finish. It's made to be drunk young so enjoy soon. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ruddy black plums and blackberries scent this lusciously ripe, rich Lemberger. It's irresistibly fruity, yet anchored by a savory edge of bramble and dried herb along with crisp cranberry acidity freshening the finish. Drink now through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Translucent, fresh aromatics, like green pears glimpsed through clear water, characterize this wine. There's also an herbal edge of fresh, green foliage on this slender and refreshing wine. The limpid purity is very convincing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The slightest whiff of pepper on the nose leads to a spiced, leesy and slender palate on this unusual Alsace resident: it's Switzerland's Chasselas making an appearance. This is slender and while the nose is shy, the palate provides ample textures. Make as a local and have this with fresh white asparagus. The wine has a great acidic spine and luminous freshness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose is like pear juice spilled onto warm earth, while the palate is more citrus-focused. A seam of almost tropical acidity links lemon to notes of pineapple, lifted by joyful freshness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh cut pear fruit flavors carry this wine. It's crisp and clean, with fresh fruit balanced against natural acidity. Drink it now while the freshness is paramount.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Planted with eight grapes, including the three Pinot “sisters”—Blanc, Gris and Noir—this site is located just below Archery Summit in the heart of the Dundee Hills. The pale, pretty rosé hue introduces this most elegant and restrained of the winery's vineyard selections. It's a velvety, finesse wine, with delicate flavors of rhubarb, cinnamon, cardamom and cocoa.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With some firm structure, this wine also has great fruitiness. It offers plenty of raspberry fruits, good acidity and a solid texture of tannins. The acidity keeps the wine perfumed and fresh. Drink the wine from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Enticing scents of spring flower, beeswax and orchard fruit come together in the glass. The elegant, linear palate shows juicy lemon, nectarine, hazelnut and a saline note framed in firm acidity. It closes crisp and clean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made with 60% Moscato di Alessandria and 40% Albanello, this earthy, intriguing white offers penetrating aromas of pressed wild flower, vineyard dust, orchard fruit and dried aromatic herb. The pervasive floral scent follows through to the mineral-driven palate along with dried peach, candied nectarine zest and chopped sage. Quality has improved immensely since the producer transferred to her spacious new cellars.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Not such a rarity these days, Albariño is turning heads in California and Oregon. This tart, juicy, and deliciously fresh effort is loaded with tangy citrus and green apple fruit. It's leesy and textural, tasting of wet stones: in sum, a wonderfully refreshing summer white.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lightly scented, this opens with aromas of yellow stone fruit, citrus and a whiff of aromatic herb. The bright, medium-bodied palate offers creamy peach, mature green apple and a hint of nectarine while a mineral note fills in the juicy finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Apple, pear and stone-fruit flavors are vibrant and fresh from nose to finish of this delicately sweet Kabinett. It offers uncomplicated refreshment, but is anchored with taut acidity and honed, steely minerality. The finish is long and persistent.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A slightly herbal, minty character gives personality to this full-bodied, generous and richly textured wine. It is attractively dry, nicely tannic, layered with black cherry, wild berry and rosemary notes. Great to drink now through 2020 with rich meats or mushrooms.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An ambitious, concentrated, but not oaky wine, this has a very dark color, aromas of black cherries, and ripe but dry flavors of blackberries and dark chocolate. It is medium to full bodied, framed by lots of fine-grained tannins and finishing with more dark fruit. It's a good wine to lay down and drink after 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made at an attractive price point, this wine delivers value and plenty of flavor, from blackberry jam to oak and black pepper. It's sturdy and structured, ready for the table or larger gathering.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a valley-floor site, this blend of 70% Zinfandel and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon delights in a depth of blackberry and cedar, reflecting well on both varieties. Firm tannin and restrained oak provide room for a touch of gun smoke and pencil lead, with a lengthy finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of plum, wild herbs and tobacco are mature and suggest that this is ready to drink. In the mouth, this is medium-bodied, with clarity and a sense of freshness. Plum, berry and cherry flavors finish in harmony. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Quite rare in the U.S. market, this ripe richly berried wine is an excellent example of Frühburgunder, an early ripening mutation of Pinot Noir. Blackberry and plum flavors are fleshy and rich, offset by soft, sunny acidity and a supple silken mouthfeel. It's just faintly tannic and approachable now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of mulled black fruits, vanilla, tobacco, orange peel and earth are a touch jumbled, but compartmentalized—this smells nice. Wiry and fresh in feel, but with a slightly hollow midsection, this tastes peppery, oaky and like cherry and black plum. A toasty finish with snappy acidity solidifies this medium-weight La Mancha Tempranillo. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From several vineyard sites and combining all five red Bordeaux varieties, this wine is fermented in stainless steel before it rests over two years in both French and American oak. Powerful, it retains an elegance amid a tannic, grippy entry of toasted oak and black cherry, and a rich textured finish accented in cinnamon and chocolate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Grippy leather and tobacco provide a gravelly texture and burly nature to this medium-bodied wine, which finds its groove in the glass. Concentrated and dense, it offers smoother elements of black currant, cassis and leather on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A deep color and oodles of blackberry and boysenberry flavors lend a lot of impact to this full-bodied, ripe and almost jammy-tasting wine. It is generous, layered and concentrated but not overly serious in terms of tannins. Call it big but friendly.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Seductive, spicy oak in the aromas and flavors puts a great spin on this medium-bodied, velvety smooth wine from a promising new winery in Northern California. Some ripe black-cherry and cranberry flavors chime in as well, supporting the toasted baguette, cedar and nutmeg nuances and layering seamlessly.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the Hearst family's run at a luxury-level Chardonnay, and it's a promising start, with creamy aromas of honeysuckle, light butter and citrus rinds. There's a touch of vanilla bean on the palate, which also shows apple ice cream, flashes of cinnamon and a firmly wound texture. It's delicate, clean, light and quaffable.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Juicy blackberry and blackcurrant mix with cocoa, cola and peppercorns on the nose of this densely layered wine. Flavors are deep and dark with tar, pencil shavings, dried blueberry, street asphalt and a strong umami character, still tightly wound at five years old. Let it breathe, or wait another couple years for optimal drinking.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tilled earth, ripe dark-skinned berry, leather and menthol aromas show this wine's Sangiovese pedigree. The robust, concentrated palate doles out crushed black cherry, raspberry jam, cinnamon, licorice and the warmth of evident alcohol—the latter a common characteristic of this hot vintage. Firm, ripe tannins provide the framework. Drink 2017–2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of fresh dill and other green herbs leap up from the glass. The plum flavors are pure and persistent. It's a unique expression of the variety.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Bordeaux-style blend is comprised of 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 43% Merlot and 13% Cabernet Franc. The fruit flavors of raspberry and blackberry are light and tangy, the tannins mellow. A note of dark chocolate highlights the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Apple, lime and mineral aromas lend freshness to a mature nose. This feels round and plump, but well balanced due to fine acidity. Peach and citrus flavors are stony and finish with tropical notes of lychee and mango. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a finely perfumed wine, rich in both structure and ripe fruits. It is smoothly textured, a full-bodied wine that has dark cherry flavors as well as a balanced layer of acidity. The wine is still young, juicy and will develop further, so drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of underbrush, charred earth, truffle, star anise and a hint of menthol come together in the glass. The ripe palate shows dried black cherry, blackberry jam, licorice and mocha alongside solid, assertive tannins. Drink 2019–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of espresso, underbrush, leather, dark spice, mature black-skinned fruit and a suggestion of oak lead the way. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, mocha, vanilla and star anise alongside fine-grained tannins that leave a dusty finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of lemon custard and pineapple are well-balanced in this blend of 50% Chardonnay, 45% Pinot Gris and 5% Pinot Blanc and the desert-them doesn't stop, as this white offers the palate a medley of crème brûlée, vanilla bean and lemon meringue pie.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas that come together are those of scorched earth, grilled porcini, roasted coffee bean and a bit of burnt rubber. The mature palate offers dried cherry, blackberry confiture, mocha, vanilla and a hint of game alongside tongue-drying tannins that clench the finish. Give this a few years to unfold then drink sooner rather than later.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Grilled herb, forest floor, scorched earth, cured meat and menthol aromas lead the way. The ripe palate offers juicy wild cherry, fleshy black raspberry, cinnamon, pipe tobacco and a confectionary note alongside firm, enveloping tannins. It's already accessible and will make fine near- to mid-term drinking.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Engaging scents suggesting rose, iris, perfumed berry and Mediterranean herb meld together in the glass. The soft, bright palate offers red cherry, raspberry, a hint of tobacco and a coffee note alongside supple tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose on this creative blend of 52% Gewürztraminer, 25% Sauvignon Blanc and 23% Chenin Blanc is quite showy with peach, baked orange, apple blossom and honeysuckle notes. But the real star is the palate that is racy with sizzling energy and flavors of cut grass, lemongrass and sour-apple peels.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sourced from 50+ year-old vines in the commune of Sorgues, this aromatic blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Syrah and 20% Mourvèdre boasts hints of rosemary, bay leaf and clove. It's reasonably full bodied, with a long, drying finish that demands another year or two in the cellar or (preferably) some rare beef or lamb.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Costco brand has become a reliable source for bargain Châteauneuf-du-Pape. This vintage is a bit firmer and more tannic than others, but it still weaves together cherry and leather notes into a pleasing whole. It might need a year or two to soften, but it should provide good drinking through 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Malbec, Merlot and Petit Verdot are included in this wine that's black-purple in color, with a thick density to its dusty black fruit. Cedar, tar and tobacco weave in between blackberry and currant, finishing in a powerful grip of tannin.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A minuscule amount of this wine was made, all of it fermented entirely in stainless steel. The result is lively in mouthcoating acidity and refreshing swirls of light-bodied mandarin orange and lime.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Grapes are sourced from both Stagecoach and Hyde vineyards in this wine that takes its time in the glass coming around. Funky brine and a tropical flourish open on the nose with a severity of oak that mellows slowly. Made in an opulent, full-bodied style, it'll pair well with buttery fare.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tropical guava and mango surround a restrained cradling of French oak, only 15% of it new, in this easy-to-like, approachable wine. Wrappings of vanilla and honeysuckle complete the picture, with a straightforward, relatively lengthy finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The first thing that leaps at you on this oddball blend of Albillo, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier is toasty oak, which overrides spice and apple aromas. In the mouth, this is full, resiny and grabby. Oak-driven flavors of vanilla, lees, peach and white pepper finish long, with elegance and a woody aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This well-balanced wine has scents of finely ground black pepper, dried cherry, black plum and violets with flavors of plum, blackberry and tart cherry. The tannins are smooth and the finish is persistent.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of wild berry, thyme and a whiff of cellar floor lead the nose on this structured red while the full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, white pepper, sage and anise. Tightly wound tannins provide framework. Give it a few years to unfurl then drink up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Caramelized oak makes a statement in this wine that starts out richly and roundly, but finds a sense of balanced acidity in the glass. Medium bodied, it features classic notes of Meyer lemon and Gravenstein apple.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This straightforward wine shows an exuberance of toasted oak and grip at first before relaxing into its more mannered self, a twist of cedar and sage giving it a classic sensibility. Cassis and black cherry take on more power on the full-bodied palate, exhibiting the soft approachability of the appellation.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Given about a year in French oak, less than half of it new, this is a cohesive blend of 53% Grenache, 29% Mourvèdre, 12% Syrah and 6% Counoise. It's brawny in meat and leather, blackberry and tar, with a velvety mouthfeel benefiting from integrated oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This flavorful and beautifully contoured wine is simply delicious. It has a lightly spicy aroma, plenty of fresh red-cherry and plum flavors, moderate acidity and tannins, and medium body.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Round and ripe, this opens with aromas that recall baked plum, vanilla, anise and a whiff of leather. The approachable, juicy palate doles out mature black cherry, blackberry, mocha, dried sage, baking spice and licorice. Polished, fine-grained tannins provide support.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Forest floor, black plum, menthol and a whiff of exotic spice unfold on this elegantly structured wine. The precise palate offers mature black cherry, ground pepper, licorice and hint of chewing tobacco framed in firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Scorched earth, underbrush, blue flower and woodland berry are some of the scents you'll find on this focused wine. The elegant, full-bodied palate delivers black raspberry, mature cherry, brown kitchen spice and a hint of leather alongside tightly wound but refined tannins. Drink 2016–2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Though just four years old, this wine seems advanced with notes of dried cherry, vanilla, dried tobacco and blackberry. The dried cranberry and cherry flavors are rich and tart, backed by quite astringent tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lighter in color than many other bottlings, this shows cherry and pepper spice on a somewhat reserved nose. But that light color unleashes a lush and ripe palate, with red berries, nutmeg and game flavors showing most prominently.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tawny in color and wafting of potpourri and fallen leaves, this raspberry-inflected wine is already starting to show its maturity. Briskly concentrated and light on its feet, it makes an elegant sip to enjoy now before it loses its delicate, perfumed charms.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas on this wine are quite light, conveying wood, herbs and red fruit. This contrasts with the sweet, rich fruit flavors with a gentle grip of tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A mix of smoke and toast blends with fresh, crisp citrus aromas on the nose. That's followed by a foamy, reactive palate with flavors of pink grapefruit, orange, pepper and caramel. This remains foamy on the finish, which is peppery and slightly bitter in flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raspberry, red currant and a pinch of oaky maple make up the nose on this Tinto Fino that sports a medium-weight body with medium-level intensity. Red-berry flavors follow the nose, while a crisp finish with red plum and raspberry flavors wraps things up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A first release, this wine offers light suggestions of red apple, herbs and tropical fruit. It's medium bodied yet leaner in style with tart acids but the concentration doesn't seem all there.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wood-aged wine conveys mint aromas and new-wood flavors. It is rich, full in the mouth and developing quickly. The black currant fruitiness is fresh, giving a delicious, juicy wine to drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This presents a big, buttery, bold style, with no apologies for the full body and ripe fruit surrounded by toasty, oaky aromas and flavors. This is dry, rich in texture, and more savory or smoky rather than fruity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Heavy aromas and flavors of oak and smoke accompany ripe black cherry and boysenberry for a rich mixture. This wine is deeply colored, full bodied and pumped up with the flavors of heavily toasted oak. A firm but not harsh texture accompanies the almost sweet taste of all that oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine offers notes of Red Hots, coffee, vanilla and herbs. Cherry and blackberry flavors are sweet and viscous in feel backed by dry tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of Marsanne (32%), Grenache Blanc (27%), Roussanne (24%), Picpoul (14%) and Viognier starts out reduced before opening to offer pear, peach, mineral and almond. It's medium bodied in feel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy aromas include new leather, scorched soil, wild berry and a touch of funky game. On the robust palate, grilled sage, tobacco and licorice add depth to a core of fleshy wild cherry along a backbone of raspy tannins and searing alcohol. Drink after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This features aromas of oak, wood shop, vanilla and toast. The densely colored, dark palate offers prune, roasted coffee bean, anise and oak alongside assertive, extremely astringent tannins that leave the mouth feeling dried out.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Strongly aromatic, this wood-aged wine is perfumed with both toast and smokiness. The palate has fruit, but the acidity both from that fruit and the wood dominates, suggesting the wine needs to age. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose on this wine from American Idol producers Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick is a bit reluctant to show itself at first, then lets go of rounded red and purple fruits, with freshly turned soil and dust. Ripe black cherries and tart plum skins mix on the earthy palate, and the tannins will unfurl with more time.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This well-made, stainless-steel-fermented and aged Chardonnay offers notes of red apple and spice. It's straightforward and provides pleasant, easy drinking.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Riesling, Muscat and Viognier blend marries the best of each and provides a lot of value. Aromas suggest apricot, white flowers, orange peel and freshly baked biscuits. It drinks full bodied and dry, but with sweet fruit flavors that linger on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here's a bright, crisp white that delivers aromas of apricot, nectarine, white peach and a whiff of Mediterranean brush that all carry over to the palate. Mineral notes add energy to the juicy fruit flavors, while zesty acidity generates a clean, refreshing finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Initial aromas of aged cheese, gym shoes and overall funk are more complicated than easy. This is lacks a center point on the palate, while flavors of briny stone fruits are drawn, buttery and oxidized. A briny apricot note rises up on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot, this wine features earthy aromas of leafy forest floor, tilled soil and dried black currant. The straightforward palate delivers juicy blackberry, raspberry and clove alongside smooth tannins. Drink through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "All coming from Block 17 of Skyline Vineyard, this is aromatic with lime, mineral and stone fruit. It drinks just off dry (7g/L residual sugar), with a phenolic, almost creamy feel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wiry aromas of berry and spice are tempered by a touch of oaky vanilla. On the palate, there's a blend of creamy oak and sharp acidity, while flavors of plum and boysenberry are tart overall but again softened by barrel-driven vanilla notes. Snappy acidity makes for a moderately sharp, pointed finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smooth, nutty aromas include vanilla and flor scents. This has a dry palate with flavors of orange, lemon, salt and peanuts. It's crisp but metallic in feel, with angular acidity and a finish that's salty in flavor and slightly oily in texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crisp, minty, herbal aromas of berry and plum lead to a bright, rumbling, tannic palate with energy. Blackberry and chocolate flavors are good and earthy, while the finish is plump but braced by lively acidity. This is well made and satisfying for a basic roble wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The oak notes of dried coconut, coffee bean and vanilla are far out front here and provide a good deal of the aromas and flavors. But some pretty things are going on in the bottle; it's just hard to get at them.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Berry and cherry aromas are fruity and clean. This blend of Carignan, Grenache and Syrah is big on the palate but also tannic, acidic and fierce. Black plum, blackberry and tomato flavors finish crisp and firm.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This concentrated wine offers warm-climate aromas of stewed plum and scorched earth. The dense palate offers prune, baked black cherry, nutmeg and clove alongside velvety tannins. It's already accessible so drink soon to capture the remaining fruit flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of cured meat, stewed fruit and toasted oak lead the nose. On the ripe palate, notes of powdered sage, vanilla and oak spices accent fleshy black plum. Bracing tannins provide the framework, but drink soon to capture the fruit richness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas suggest oak, vanilla, plum, espresso and coconut. The tightly wound palate isn't very expressive but offers dried black fruit, roasted coffee bean and clove alongside raspy tannins, with the heat of alcohol on the close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Young Touriga Nacional vines produced this crisp, refreshing wine. With red currant flavor and a light touch of caramel, it's both fruity and full in the mouth. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made with no added sulfites, this has aromas suggesting resin and balsamic notes. The palate is almost overripe and rather evolved, offering dried apricot and crystallized ginger while a note of candied nectarine zest marks the close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From an estate vineyard, this wine is robust, full-bodied and viscous, with an underlying hint of petrol and plenty of oak. There's a tartness behind its flavors that gives it a lift as it finds its way to the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a touch of barnyard on the nose of this bottling, which also shows a soy and sweet black cherry scents. The palate is marked by beef char and cooked black fruit flavors, with a twist of funkiness, lending intrigue.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is full of red berry flavor and soft tannins. With its forward fruit and smooth texture, it's made to be drunk young, so drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Although this San Juan SB offers almost nothing on the nose, it's fresh and popping with acidity on the palate. Flavors of briny citrus are entirely familiar, while this finishes with cleansing crispness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rose petal aromas and lychee flavors make this a colorful and lively wine to sniff and sip. The powerful floral and fruity character rests in a soft, sweet texture that carries into a lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is produced from two of the quintas owned by Ramos-Pinto. It's fruity and crisp, packed with bright fruit and lively acidity, and finishes on tangy citrus with a riper, creamy texture. Drink from late 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is a pale cherry-red in color, showing some bricking. It brings off-dry elegantly styled cherry flavors that winnow toward the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dried cranberry and currant flavors with raisin-plum cake undertones define this light-bodied wine that's mildly tannic, tart, simple and easy to like.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This boxed Malbec is burgundy-colored and opens with spicy reedy aromas of dried herbs and red-berry fruits. On the palate, this is tight but shallow in the midtier. Flavors of baked plum and berry fruits come with a note of cocoa powder prior to a stable finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Muted, soft scents of green apple, orange peel and underripe banana dance on the nose, while the zippy, prickly palate offers pithy flavors of citrus zest, ending slightly bitter. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% varietal wine is aged in American oak, offering an approachable, rounded, full-bodied impression of pencil shavings, cherry, leather and tobacco bound by firm tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Concentrated orange blossom, bubblegum and a touch of minerality show on the nose of this bottling, suggesting sweetness. The palate is dry, if a tad syrupy, revealing warm climate flavors like poached apple, pear and lemon curd, tasting a bit like cough syrup.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of green wood, herb and cherry lead to ripe but chalky feeling fruit flavors. There's some interesting things going on but a sense of astringency and bitterness proves distracting.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A substantial dose of fruit and good, grippy texture make this hearty wine ready for any protein dishes. It has full body, tasty black cherry and plum flavors and moderate tannins that lend structure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of Colombard and Chardonnay, this wine is crisp and fruity. It has attractive bright acidity with lemon fruitiness and a mineral texture. The wine is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Jammy blueberry aromas come with overt oakiness. This feels dense but on the flat side. Baked berry flavors and herbal plum notes sprinkle in a mild sweet and green accent, while this feels full and a bit syrupy on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bottling is ripe and tropical but approachable on the nose, with honeydew melon, banana and nectarine aromas. There is a decent punch of acidity and noticeable texture upon first sip, veering toward sweet apple and bubblegum flavors on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A mild nose with little extravagance offers modest lemon aromas. The palate on this light-bodied white holds onto that lemony character via pithy, somewhat yeasty citrus flavors. The short non-effusive finish is tangy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Squeezed lime, wet concrete and green apple rind scents show on the nose of this basic bottling. Kaffir lime tang meets with ripe red apple and pear notes on the palate, framed by a stony texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a young, fruity wine made for early drinking. With bright acidity, soft tannins and forward red fruit, it's easy-drinking and ready now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoke, brawny black pepper and black cherry flavors meet on the palate of this intensely ripe wine. It's grippy and high-octane in power, with a layering of mocha dust.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tasting strongly of spicy wood, this wine is firm, with a tight, granitic texture. Tannins and acidity anchor its blackberry fruit, yielding a structured wine that is ready to drink.\n",

      "This straightforward, affordable dry wine is good and fruity, with medium body, moderate tannins and plenty of red cherry and blackberry flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose of this blend of 58% Syrah, 17% Cabernet Franc, 9% Merlot, 8% Malbec and 8% Petite Sirah is a touch funky, with sour blackberry, charcoal and dried meat aromas. Charred blueberry, sour black plum and savory meat flavors show on the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a grassy, herbal wine with attractive acidity and the crispest hint of apricots and some distinctive spice. It is fruity, ready to drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This dull, rustic wine offers earth and anise flavors around a core of soft cherry fruit. Light bodied, its acidity is moderate and unobtrusive.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine comes from the northern reaches of Tejo, giving it a structured, cool and bright, fruity character. Juicy acidity cuts through its tannins and black plum flavor. Needing a few more months of bottle age, it will be ready to drink in 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a fashionably pale rosé, as light and bright in color as it is on the palate. Fruity, attractive and ready to drink, it has zesty orange peel and crisp wild strawberry flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from what Californians call the Pommard clone, this has a light, traditional garnet color. Fresh and lively fruit aromas resemble cranberries and red cherries, followed by tangy fruit and cinnamon flavors of medium intensity, supported by firm acidity and moderate tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of leather, cherry and plum lead this balanced red from Boutari. Ripe cherry, cedar and cinnamon flavors carry the palate, with soft tannins giving a sultry feel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 70% Grenache and 30% Syrah offers remarkable value. Thyme- and bay-scented black cherry aromas fill the glass, while the flavors add an intriguing hint of raspberry. It's not overly weighty or tannic, making it ideal for drinking any season.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Sangiovese opens with aromas of blue flowers, underbrush, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of roasted coffee beans, all of which carry over to the concentrated palate along with black pepper and clove. The tannins are still tightly wound but drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit richness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of local Duras and Braucol with the more Mediterranean Syrah is attractively spicy and juicy. It is packed with red fruits, sweet berry flavors and ripe tannins. The wine is maturing well and will be ready to drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a sweet, honeyed wine, rich with apricot fruit flavors and fresh with balancing acidity. It's fruity, mineral and generous, a great wine for fruit desserts.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pressed apple and pears seem to be dusted in pollen and saffron on the nose of this savory, spicy Riesling. It's off dry and delicate in style, but concentrated in lip smacking tangerine and lime flavors. Dusty, earthy tones persist through the moderately long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Alpine sparkler opens with aromas that recall honeysuckle, lily of the valley and candied citrus. The firm palate delivers ripe yellow apple, nectarine zest, candied ginger and toasted walnut accompanied by crisp acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is full bodied and forward, bringing a generous mouthful of apple, pear and pineapple fruit along with a streak of vanilla wafer. The flavors hit quickly and right up front, then suspend themselves through a lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bloody meats, dried cherries, pressed purple flowers, vanilla and blackberry jam arise on the nose of this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Cabernet Franc and 7% Merlot, which shows a little age. The purple flowers really come through once sipped, backed up by sour cherries, mocha and sanguine elements, cast across grippy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made with Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of toast, coffee, black currants and a whiff of cedar. The palate delivers dried black cherries, espresso, grilled sage and a leathery note alongside assertive, astringent tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "La Guillotte is a parcel on the Bouissel estate, planted with old Négrette. This firm and structured wine is solid with black plum fruits and cherry acidity. It is still developing and will need some time to soften its tannins. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The estate reserve gets more new and once-filled oak, and is a selection from vines whose yield has been dropped to 1.5 tons/acre. It's forward and flavorful, with black cherry, coffee and anise components. The entry is smooth and continues so, on through a finish complete with sandalwood and butterscotch.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This firm, well-crafted wine reflects the lightness of the vintage. Raspberry, citrus and stone components come across in a balanced effort that should continue to drink well until 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Warm berry-rhubarb pie notes mix with black pepper and an appealing, shy layer of green bell pepper on this blend of 50% Merlot, 28% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc and 2% Petit Verdot from three vineyards. Stewed plums, cherries and strawberries dominate the tasty palate, with a proper acidity and woody bitterness as balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A palate of exotic perfumes with layers of dark chocolate and dense tannins certainly give this wine great power. It is dark and brooding—almost too much in the intensity of its flavors and structure. It's going to remain a big beast as it ages. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Boysenberry, dried violets and black pepper show on the nose of this wine from a popular vineyard in the Alisos Canyon area near Los Alamos. The mouthfeel is lively, fresh and driven by a generous acidity, yet the flavors remain rich with purple fruits, licorice and black tobacco.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Sangiovese opens with aromas of crushed blackberry, ripe plum and blue flowers. On the palate, notes of anise and black pepper accent the core of fleshy black cherry while assertive but polished tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2016–2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This brooding wine opens with aromas of mature blue and black fruit, allspice, charred earth and whiff of game. The palate delivers spiced blueberry, blackberry, ground pepper, licorice and tobacco alongside assertive tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy berry and licorice aromas are composed, lightly oaked and attractive. This standard Priorato blend of Grenache, Carignan and Syrah is fresh feeling, with a bolt of bracing acidity. Juicy plum and raspberry flavors finish loamy, earthy and balanced. For a wine that's no heavyweight, this is strong throughout. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This widely available wine delivers aromas of cherries, leather and Provençal herbs upfront, followed by a silky texture on the palate and hints of cocoa. Drink it over the next few years.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dried strawberries, wild berries, cloves cinnamon and cocoa powder power the nose on this bottling from a vineyard named after a famous composer who once owned the property. There's not much fruit on the palate, just a touch of dried black cherries, but plenty of dried herbs, milk and dark chocolate and mocha-cappuccino flavors. It's a touch hot.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blackberry, cassis, herb and spice aromas are complete and ripe. This Cabernet-led blend is focused and direct on the palate, with berry, cassis, chocolate and oaky flavors. A similar tasting finish, with additional chocolate and creamy oak is weighty and pleasing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pure Syrah, this is young, spicy and crisp, with blue plum, red licorice and a streak of dark chocolate. It has a light suggestion of the gamy, cured meat character that typifies Syrah. This marks a good start for such young (second leaf) vines.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Remarkably strong cinnamon characterizes the nose of this old-vine wine, which also shows red and black cherries, potpourri and gingerbread on the nose. Black raspberries, cranberry-pomegranate juice, dark chocolate, purple flowers, black pepper and cardamom entertain the palate, which also offers decent acidity and grip, but finishes quickly.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fruit from the Momtazi vineyard often has a strong herbal component, here matched to a tart cranberry base. This wine is young, tight, and slightly bitter in the finish, with a hint of pineapple in the acidity. Overall the winemaker's elegant hand lightens up the aggressive herbaceousness, but a bit more fruit would be welcome.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Look for the blue bottle and you'll get a solid Albariño. This is typically light and fresh, with aromas of stream water, wild flowers, fresh herbs and leesy stone fruits. Crisp and citric on the palate, with proper cut, this tastes of orange, peach, nectarine and lemon. Minerally, cleansing and steady on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot opens with aromas of bluish-black fruit, toasted oak, espresso and licorice. The palate delivers blackberry extract, anise, clove and tobacco while dusty tannins provide support.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Briary, dry, lightly oaked aromas of plum and berry lead to a bright, forward, juicy palate with fresh acidity and racy flavors of cherry and plum. This is short but clean on the finish, and overall it's the type of simple, drinkable, affordable Ribera del Duero that fans of the region don't come across often enough.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mineral, citrus and dusty aromas are textbook for brut Cava. A round, full palate shows good grip and acidity, while flavors of lemon-lime and nectarine finish with notes of lime and green banana. Nothing about this is overwhelming, but the sum of its parts add up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an excellent Chardonnay for an accessible price. It's balanced and textured, with bites of apple and anise highlighting the journey. Power and finesse are offered in equal measure. A delicious wine for the table, it will impress with its depth and complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A parcel of old vines in the Brandluft vineyard gives the typical concentration and intense minerality to be expected from low yields. The wine is perfumed, with a bone-dry texture and melon and orange fruitiness. It needs to age, so drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rui Madeira's flagship red is a formidable, powerful wine. It has intense tannins that are surrounded by dark fruits and rich, juicy acidity. The core is dry, concentrated and dense, and the wood aging shows against the background of ripe fruits, promising good aging potential. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spicy in black plum and berry fruit, Black Chicken is a consistent blockbuster for Biale, alive and fresh in waves of exotic cinnamon and clove. Built to age 2020–2022, it'll satisfy in complex black tea and savory toasty oak, an easy wine to love. The grapes are sourced from the winery's estate sites within the Oak Knoll District, where it's based.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Muted black plum teases from the nose of this wine, a blend of 73% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 8% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot. Amidst a wall of dusty tannins still needing time to soften, you'll find clove, blackberry and a treasure trove of chocolate and vanilla.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a single-vineyard, estate-grown and bottled, this is an intense 100% Cabernet, generous in roasted plum, cedar and coffee. With supple tannins it's easy to enjoy, concentrated and dark, a good match for roasted meats and savory pies.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie and Winemaker Joey Tensley converge on a blend of Syrah, Merlot, Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon that's worth sitting on until at least 2019. Woody, cigar box aromas pick up notes of camphor and flashes of red fruit, and the flavors fall in line around the cedar, with blueberry, black cherry and milk chocolate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Coming from vines ranging in age from 9–39 years, this is an aromatically complex wine, with notes of wet slate, orange peel and herb. It drinks off dry, with tart, mouthwatering acidity accenting the abundant stone fruit flavors—a thriller of a wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Working from an urban winery on Santa Barbara's Eastside, Matthias Pippig created the Loner Chardonnay series. This entry begins with scents of cider, nectarine and lemon-lime soda before delving into a palate laden with yellow fruits and flowers. Sourdough yeastiness surrounds a lingering line of grapefruit zest-led acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A solid, firm wine with a great rapport between the black berry fruits, juicy acidity and dark tannins. It has a fresh element along with a powerful structure and dense mineral texture. It will age well, so drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With voluptuous confectionary-like aromas surrounded by a rich toasty character, this wine from the wonderful Hyde Vineyard offers lemon and crisp yellow apple around a core of brilliant minerality. Vanilla and crème brûlée interplay on the palate, the body of the wine firm and round.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a rich, full-bodied and wood-aged wine, produced from vines in the village of Panasqueira. It has herbal and mint flavors, with black fruit tones powered by structured tannins. It is impressive, ripe, and still maturing. Best after 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big points for subtlety, length and elegance here—this is not a wine that will blow you away at first sniff. Stay with it and it stays with you; opening sharp-edged, pungent and slightly grassy, then developing a tightly focused midpalate with pure lime and apple fruit flavors. Accents of mustard greens and white pepper come in as a long, delicate yet detailed finish slowly unfolds.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Scents of effervescent cherry and mint run with emergent licorice and slate on this wine that proves lithe yet flavorful on the palate. Lovely blackberry flavors and black pepper make for a very balanced bottling that doesn't rely on bombastic power to tell the Syrah story.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This single-vineyard wine shows both the warmth of the vintage and the coolness of this site, boasting depth and richness to the fruit flavors while retaining good acidity. It combines notes of apple, peach and lees with light barrel accents—20% new French—and a creamy feel. Enjoy with shrimp stir fried in olive oil for a pairing nirvana.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is rich and full-bodied, a splendid wine with its ripe yellow fruits, intensely aromatic character and a pinch of pepper. Concentrated, it finishes with a light touch of toastiness that hints at the maturity to come. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Part of the impressive series of Jubilée wines that are aged before release, this Hugel Riesling is just getting to maturity with its soft aromatic character, touch of toastiness, and refreshing herbal flavors. It's now ready to drink, although it will be even better from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This begins with scents of dried orange rinds and mango laced with honey as well as deeper aromas of rocks and savory herbs. A tight lemon acidity runs down the middle of the palate, with yellow flowers, yeast and toasted pine nuts on the side. It's both racy and rounded, and is showing a touch of age.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Honeysuckle and jasmine pique interest aromatically before luscious, linear waves of vanilla, caramel and lemon custard graciously interject, buoyed by ample acidity and a lush texture. This Chardonnay offers generous richness alongside high-toned minerality, and is a delicious go-to for buttery lobster dishes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is straw in color, with delightful notes of lemon curds and apricot blossoms. On the palate, freshly picked apricot and Anjou pear provide the core to a slightly spiced backdrop, finishing crisp and clean. Pair this wine with your favorite spicy Asian dish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An appealing fragrance of red rose and violet mingled with a whiff of baking spices drifts out of the glass. The juicy palate offers crushed Morello cherry, vanilla, licorice and cinnamon alongside firm but fine tannins. It's a balanced, classic Barbaresco.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Abundant flavors combine with a plush texture to make a wine that slowly builds interest from the first sniff to the lingering aftertaste. Hints of vanilla and honeysuckle enhance the vivid apricot flavors, lasting long on the viscous palate and through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Red berry, blue lilac, baking spice and Mediterranean herb lead the nose. On the palate, notes of white pepper, sage and tobacco back up the bright red cherry flavors. It's still young, with aggressive tannins and bright acidity. Drink after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This special selection, tight-cropped from 30 acres of 100% Merlot, is ripe and rich. This is a smoky and fruity wine, in barrel for 14 months. It has ripe black fruits and rich, dense structure. Spice and toast balance the fruit, giving an impressive sense of generosity. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a small parcel of land on the slopes of the Serra de Aire hills, this firm textured, cool-climate wine shows structure and depth. The fruit weight is concentrated with plum and juicy black currant flavors, rotating around a dry core of tannins. Age this complex wine and drink after 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is pure minerality, tightly woven into a tense structure and fruits that are still very young. It's complex, allying fruit with a texture that is steely and only developing slowly. It will be impressive as it ages. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas of this Chardonnay are zesty and fresh yet rich, with barrel smoke, caramelized pear and vanilla tones. The integration continues on the palate, with a bit of oak followed by apple, white peach, nectarine and lime zest. It's flavorful and enjoyable now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deep, pure cassis and red berry aromas are integrated and thorough. This Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Merlot is racy, tight and hard-driving, with bold berry, pepper, baking spice and chocolate flavors. A toasty, peppery finish is juicy, forward and long. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Winemaker Mark McNeilly from Mark Ryan Winery makes this estate grown Viognier, and works it in the same strong, substantial, concentrated style as his own release. The mix of concrete and neutral oak fermentation brings out some nice floral highlights and a light hint of toast. The length and flavor development through the long finish are exceptional.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Unctuous and ripe in caramel and toasty aromas, this is deep golden in color but completely crisp and balanced in the glass. The nose is so overwhelming that the flavors take time to show. Once they do, it's a celebration of green apple and melon enveloped in complex minerality and a supple body.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a classic version of the varietal, matching complex herb and cherry aromas with fresh, frank fruit flavors that also show hints of mint, clove and anise. It is all about vibrancy and balance, not full body, and has a welcome, appetizing personality.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An interesting vein of tasty herb flavor runs through this full-bodied, plump and fruity wine. The aroma has hints of dill and sage, and these mingle with black cherry and blueberry on the palate. A sleek texture and long finish complete the picture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Kirsten's Feinherb, or gently sweet bottling, maintains a firm foundation of stoniness, but also embraces softer, less angular dimensions of spring blossom and peach. High-toned acidity brighten and lifts the palate through a long finish. Drink now through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Situated close to the northern edge of Beaune vineyards, this premier cru has something of the soft ripeness of Savigny-lès-Beaune next door. The wine is ripe, with tannins that are present although certainly not dominant. It has the potential to revel in its red fruits and generous texture. Drink this wine from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This structured wine still has wood aromas although on the palate the rich, dark fruits dominate. The tannins both from wood and from the fruit are firm and still young, showing the possibility of long-term aging. This complex wine should not be drunk before 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Quite a steal of a deal for a widely available wine, this shows cinnamon, red cherry, ripe cranberry, light tobacco and a touch of leather on the rustic nose. Once sipped, the mouthfeel is soft, offering flavors of cranberry and red cherry that are spiced by thyme, bay leaf and more cinnamon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hazelnut and truffle compete for affection in this juicy, rounded, lovable wine, a full-bodied and structured example from the appellation, known for its at-times generous portrait of tannin and wound-up concentration.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Luscious white peach and apricot flavors are anchored by a steely core of mineral in this easy-drinking but elegant wine. Light bodied but persistent, it's a lip-smacking, sweet wine that finishes with a touch of brambly herbaceousness. Drink now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas like wild berries and sage lead to moderate cherry and raspberry flavors in this medium-bodied wine. With each sip the fruit flavor seems to deepen and the finish seems to lengthen because of the wine's strong concentration and lively texture with just the right amount of tannin.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offers heady aromas of honeysuckle, white stone fruit, dill, hay and a vegetal note that recalls tomato leaf. The tangy palate offers juicy grapefruit, white peach and honeydew melon while mouthwatering salinity provides depth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of this wine show considerable wood. On the palate, the wood is very present, giving acidity as well as layers of toast and spice. Hints of yellow fruit show through, suggesting the possibility of a ripe, rich wine in the future. Drink from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A soft, stony scent of pebble and the faintest melon signals a fresh, clean wine. The palate plays these aromas out softly but also with precision. That stoniness lingers on the dry, gentle finish and the lasting flavor of fresh apple peel\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With tannins and new-wood flavors, this rich wine is also structured. A smoky character from the wood is shot through by perfumed red fruits. The aftertaste shows more of the wood flavors that need to integrate. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Subtle hints of ripe, winter-stored apple on the nose lead to an equally apple-dominated palate that shows soft pepper spice. A wonderful midpalate texture and baked-apple richness are countered by lemon freshness. This is very appetizing and cries out for soft cheeses.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "White summer blossoms and ripe green pears make for a fresh scent. The palate lifts these notions with bright lemon acidity. All is buoyed by some residual carbon dioxide. Drink soon while this is at its aromatic height.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a sophisticated blend of tart yellow fruits with hints of cucumber, salad greens and lemon oil. Though 80% stainless steel fermented, the rest spent time in new oak. The mineral rich acids provide extra grip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made entirely with Nero d'Avola, this offers aromas of black-skinned fruit, tilled earth and cake spice. The concentrated but also focused palate shows ripe black cherry and crushed raspberry while nutmeg and carob add depth. Lithe tannins and lively acidity provide the framework.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This youthful wine is shyer on the nose than its 2013 counterpart, but is still in development, revealing a complex and layered richness of red cherry and berry, as well as dried herb and lavender.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here's a lively Moscato made in a dry style that opens with heady scents of jasmine, citrus blossom and yellow stone fruit aromas. The vibrant palate tastes of apricot, tangerine zest and a note of botanical herb alongside fresh acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crisp acidity and a gorgeous, aromatic nose lead on this elegant white. Though mineral-driven, it offers generous white peach and grapefruit flavors that will pair well with fuller-bodied fish. Impressive and versatile.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Among the well-differentiated single vineyard selections from Soléna in 2014, this may be the most instantly enjoyable. It's a big, mouth-coating wine, a full-flavored burst of chocolate-covered cherries. Lighter notes of coffee and tobacco filter in through the extended finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The oak in this wine is restrained, partly because it aged in stainless steel and a sizable percentage of neutral oak. Still, a richness of apple and pear compote provide a steady level of richness, while a lemon squeeze of acidity keeps it fresh and youthful.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of iris, rose, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of baking spice lead nose. The juicy, easy-drinking palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, black raspberry and black pepper alongside bright acidity and supple tannins. Chill this down for the perfect summer red.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Seductive, spicy oak in the aromas and flavors puts a great spin on this medium-bodied, velvety smooth wine from a promising new winery in Northern California. Some ripe black-cherry and cranberry flavors chime in as well, supporting the toasted baguette, cedar and nutmeg nuances and layering seamlessly.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Baked, rooty aromas of sandalwood, exotic spices and berry fruits are attractive. Though slightly grabby on the palate, this shows the right structure and build. Flavors of up-front oak, herbal plum and raspberry finish dry, with firm, pinching tannins. Drink through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Berry and cinnamon aromas are lightly woody and spicy. This is tannic but not mean or fierce. Flavors of oaky plum and berry fruits turn savory in front of a finish with a dry, snappy, slightly raw feel. Given that 2013 was a cold vintage, this Crianza deserves praise.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This full-bodied wine combines deep, ripe fruit flavors, light spicy accents and a very firm mouthfeel that begs for a bite of a grilled rosemary lamb chop. The wine pushes the stereotype of wimpy Merlot out of the way and does it with fruit concentration rather than obvious oak. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Apple, pear and stone-fruit flavors are vibrant and fresh from nose to finish of this delicately sweet Kabinett. It offers uncomplicated refreshment, but is anchored with taut acidity and honed, steely minerality. The finish is long and persistent.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A slightly herbal, minty character gives personality to this full-bodied, generous and richly textured wine. It is attractively dry, nicely tannic, layered with black cherry, wild berry and rosemary notes. Great to drink now through 2020 with rich meats or mushrooms.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An ambitious, concentrated, but not oaky wine, this has a very dark color, aromas of black cherries, and ripe but dry flavors of blackberries and dark chocolate. It is medium to full bodied, framed by lots of fine-grained tannins and finishing with more dark fruit. It's a good wine to lay down and drink after 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cherry pie and nuanced spice flavors buoy this delicately layered, medium-bodied vineyard designate that's built of robust fruit and supported quietly by oak. A thread of white pepper persists throughout, making it especially irresistible.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An aromatic textural wine, Wichmann sources fruit from the winery's oldest vines. Strawberry and cherry flavors are woven into details of citrus and tea. This elegant well-proportioned effort provides a feminine contrast to the sturdy Coast Range bottling.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the home estate of Madiran superstar Alain Brumont. The wine is big, bold, rich and packed with both fruit and tannins. It has great structure and a dense dusty tannic character that promises great aging. This is a major wine that needs time. Drink it starting from 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This tremendous red wine is robustly aromatic, layering its black currant, dark cherry and chocolate scents with dusty sage and cedar. Luxuriously textured and smooth, it finishes focused and direct, with a lift of welcome acidity and complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a cool part of the Napa Valley, this wine is bright and medium bodied—a moderately oaked mix of lemon custard, floral citrus and green apple flavors with an underlying spark of lemongrass and ginger. Richly layered, it remains balanced and structured as it opens in the glass.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Many are now playing with the low-alcohol, nervy side of Chardonnay, but Doug Margerum succeeds more than most. This bottling is light in the glass, with clean and crisp Asian pear, nectarine and mandarin pith aromas. The palate is tightly wound and energetic, showing sharp citrus and rounded strone-fruit flavors. Drink now–2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "One of the finest whites of the vintage, this exquisite bottling has an enticing bouquet of almond, orchard fruit, almond and chopped herb. The elegantly structured palate delivers mouthwatering peach, apricot, almond and energizing mineral ntoes that carry over to the long, lingering finish, along with a hint of tangerine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Eight years is about right for a Madiran to start its mature phase. This wine is just there, a ripe expression of Tannat. It still has tannins and they will remain, but the fruit has lost its raw youth and has become rich with dried fruits and acidity working well together. Drink this wine now and until 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This lovely, layered wine from the Santa Ynez Valley-based producer shows iron, cranberry, shiitake, cola and cherry on the nose. Those same elements are delicately woven into the palate, enhanced by a Sichuan peppercorn kick and vibrant acidity that will ensure a long life ahead. Its flavors continue to unwind as it opens in the glass.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromatically compelling, this offers a complex mix of clover, chocolate and cherry in the nose. It is a substantial, fruit-packed wine, with cherry and plum fruit, a full-bodied midpalate, mouthfilling texture and nicely integrated barrel spices. It finishes with a streak of Meyer lemon acidity. Drink now through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Produced from old Malbec vines in the second terrace above the River Lot, the wine is darkly concentrated, with solid tannins and generous black fruits. Aging for 12 months has smoothed the square corners to create a wine that is hugely rich and rounded. It has the potential to age and become more opulent. Drink from 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cloudy, pungent and supremely earthy, this wine reveals its delicate acidity over time, bringing balance to its flamboyant fruit. With intense strawberry, orange peel and black tea flavors, it's savory and richly built, finishing on a touch of smoky vanilla.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pepper and cinnamon strike first, before beautifully aromatic notions of blueberry, plum and tart black cherry appear. These scented fruits pervade the entire palate with spice, verve and freshness. A wonderfully poised Sankt Laurent at the perfect intersection of restrained freshness and glorious richness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "High-toned aromas of cranberry, herb, black licorice and dried cherry are followed by tightly wound dark-fruit flavors backed by firm tannins. The finish extends into the distance. It's a highly structured wine, with its best days far in front of it. Best from 2021 through 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Complemented with 11% Cabernet Franc, this vineyard designate from winemaker Jesse Katz shines in fragrant plum, raspberry and blackberry flavors. Softly layered and balanced, it teases with dark chocolate and clove hints.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Baked red cherry, vanilla pastry, loam, dried mint and forest floor notes all show in this excellent bottling from Bryan Babcock's family vineyard. Its tannic structure is immediately apparent, framing a core of raspberry fruit rounded out with thyme, oregano, black pepper and sea salt flavors. Drink 2021–2029.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deep dark berry aromas come with notes of vanilla, gritty spice and tobacco. Hard tannins require cushion and this has just enough to handle things. Blackberry, cassis, barrel spice and molasses flavors finish with savory oak notes, chocolate and lingering blackberry fruit. Drink through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Juicy, vivid black cherry fruit appears on the nose of this wine, with a touch of tar and brooding elderberry. The palate brims with those appetizing flavors and adds an edge of licorice to the fruit. It's fresh and vibrant, with a fine, taut, gossamer structure. A delicious Pinot Noir that's as elegant as it is refreshing and honest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Upon first pour, this only shows some earthy hints of evolution. With air, the aromas awaken and lovely notes hayflower notes emerge. The palate is laced with elderberry and dried oak leaf flavors and framed by smooth tannins. Just a little bottle age has given this an almost timeless elegance, proving a wine doesn't need power to shine, just depth. Drink now–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bottling reveals that this historic vineyard can produce incredibly rich wine as well as the zestier styles it is known for. It shows black cherry, candied strawberry and bourbon-like spice on the nose. The mouthfeel is lavish, full of purple fruit and floral flavors, as well as peppery spice and vanilla warmth. The acidity and structure are solid, and there's a touch of tar on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crisp with peach and apricot goodness, this full-bodied white's gravelly texture works to its advantage, providing both steely acidity and grip. That grit becomes velvety smooth as the wine opens in the glass, making it irresistibly seductive and inviting.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fruit from the oldest blocks in this pioneering vineyard is sourced here. It's bright, spicy and focused, with forward citrus-scented Bing cherry flavors. The concentration and length are outstanding, with just the lightest suggestion of green herbs rounding out the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright, firmly structured and full of classic berry and savory flavors, this wine is rich but balanced and ready to serve with a steak, chop or rack for a special occasion. It has ripe fruit bolstered by firm acidity and a healthy coating of fine-grained, grippy tannins. Best after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Grown against all odds (and against all likelihood of economic viability) overlooking the Pacific Ocean atop Catalina Island, this Chardonnay is a success every vintage. It shows a broad spectrum of nutty aromas, from macadamia to cashew, with touches of honey and daffodil. On the palate, expect walnut, vanilla and oak smoke, with a butterscotch-like finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Another beauty from this producer and this appellation, Hughes is about granite-like minerality and rocky dust—a big-boned powerhouse from a powerful vintage that boasts generous spiced plum, cola, clove and black pepper flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Oak leaf, tart strawberry and supple vanilla aromas appear immediately on the nose and continue their smooth interplay on the mellow palate. This is pliable in texture but has depth, backbone and inherent freshness. Delicious now, it has an underlying taut structure that will benefit from some bottle age. Drink 2018–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A collaboration between Sonoma County-based winemaker Jesse Katz and Ken Forrester of South Africa, this 100% varietal red is robust and rich. Dark cherry, red currant and integrated oak flavors support its bold body.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This distinctive, complex and layered wine brings a unique aromatic profile of raspberries, sage and spice before fanning out across the palate with gorgeous raspberry syrup, dark chocolate and blackberry flavors. Its lightly grippy texture of fine-grained tannins perfectly counters the plush effusiveness of its fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Like it's bigger sibling El Anejón, this Reserva from a warm vintage is almost one-quarter Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in addition to Tinto Fino (Tempranillo). The opening of burnt earth, brandied cherry, rubber and herbal aromas is distinct. This feels a bit tough and chewy, with boysenberry, cassis, vanilla-cream and herbal spice flavors. A fairly smooth finish is young and vital. This should improve with aging. Best from 2019–2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A structured and still young wine from the estate owned by the Tari family, formerly of Château Giscours in Margaux. It is packed with black fruits, spice and dense tannins that are melding together so well. Licorice and wood aging give the wine an extra complex dimension. Drink this from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hendry Vineyard Zinfandels are among Napa's best. With this release, Rock Wall brings their high alcohol, lusty touch to the wine. It's a huge Zin, dry and tannic, with ripe blackberry, dark chocolate and crushed black peppercorn flavors. Drink it now and through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This estate-grown, organic Chardonnay is a terrific value, detailed and brightly fruity, with precise angles and spicy details. The apple/pear/pineapple fruit flavors are crisply defined, perfectly ripe, and beautifully balanced.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is a successful blend of various mountain vineyards. It's a classic California Cab, rich in tannins, with brisk acidity and finely-etched black currant, cassis, mineral and oak flavors. Blended with some Merlot, it's fancy and elegant, a real beauty to drink now, and will hold in the bottle until 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With strong wood-aging flavors, this is a full, very ripe and concentrated wine. Coming from old vines, it has depth of flavor, both fruity and rich. Peach and pear flavors dominate, along with spice from wood aging. The wine needs some aging, so drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intense aromas recall fragrant jasmine and honeysuckle alongside whiffs of exotic fruit. The round palate delivers juicy green apple, citrus and hints of yellow peach that end on a mineral note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Right out of the bottle, it's all about acidity and fresh, primary raspberry and cherry jam fruit. Wait until 2018 allow more complex mushroom flavors to emerge, as the wine gradually sheds tannins and develops secondary bottle notes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Whiffs of spice, honeycomb and lanolin meld curiously on the nose of this intensely mineral Riesling. Dry in style, with pretty yellow-cherry flavor, it builds in concentration and complexity as shades of spice, rock and fruit amass against a backdrop of sunny tangerine acidity. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This dainty off-dry Riesling is marked by aromas—ripe stone fruit and florals against a backdrop of tea leaves and crushed minerals. On the palate, it's intensely juicy, with flavors of orange, mango and peach, but with a streak of acidity that ripples the tongue.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lavish aromas of ripe peach, canteloupe and honeysuckle extend onto the palate of this juicy, fruit-forward Riesling. Semi-sweet in style, it's one lipsmacking nectar, with bracing lime acidity on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Zesty lime and evergreen notes mingle with luscious peach, plum and cherry aromas on this semisweet Scheurebe. The palate is juicy in stone fruit flavor, but refreshing and cool, with a bracing hit of acidity that lingers on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoke and jasmine-tea notes mingle seductively on this brisk, gorgeously floral off-dry Riesling. The palate is lush, with ripe peach and nectarine flavors that fill the mouth, finishing long.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This smooth, richly textured wine offers concentrated sensations of exotic fruit, apricot, smoky mineral, golden apple, hazelnut and a hint of honey. The palate is brightened by crisp acidity that gives a crisp finish. This will develop more complexity over the next few years. Drink now–2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the estate vineyard, this is thick with spicy flavors of fresh-cut pear. There's a hint of butter and a slightly minty aspect. All in all it's complex, rich and inviting, with penetrating acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is full of fruit, dusty tannins and great structure. A smooth surface covers the complex, juicy black fruits, dense tannins and mineral texture. This wine will certainly age, so don't drink before 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Chardonnay is rich in all the bells and whistles, such as aging on the lees in French oak barrels. The underlying fruit shows ripe, racy tropical flavors, as well as peach and pear notes that are deep and delicious. With production of 8,400 cases, the wine should be easy to find.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Still young, it has dense tannins, spice from wood aging and a smoky bacon flavor that is still integrating. It will have the right weight and good berry fruits as it ages, giving a sense of presence and grandeur. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is as dry as Chardonnay gets, almost severe, with the alcohol an amazingly low 13.2% by volume. The lean, angular mouthfeel provides hints of Meyer lemons, limes and wet stones, with a bit of tropical fruits suggesting that this is California, despite the vintage being the chilliest in memory. Drink it through 2020, but never too cold.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Malbec. Cab Sauv brings rich black currants, as well as thick tannins. Merlot adds softer notes of cherries and violets. The Malbec increases the tannins, along with notes of grilled meat bone that Syrah, with its peppery, beef-jerky meatiness, enhances. The result is a young, vigorous wine, dry and balanced in acidity. It may or may not age, but there's no reason not to decant it now and enjoy with grilled beefsteak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here's a big Pinot Noir, dark, dense and tannic. In part, those tannins are due to 30% whole-cluster fermentation, which also gives the wine a brooding earthiness and spiciness. Fully dry, it's packed with black cherry, rhubarb and pomegranate fruits. Hold it until 2018 and see how it's doing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe, juicy peaches and nectarines burst from the nose and palate of this semisweet Riesling. Sunny and pristine, with a soft, lacy sweetness, it's balanced by bristling acidity and a delicate minerality on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh, herbaceous notes on the nose and palate lend elegance to this rich, round Riesling, full of sweet canteloupe and peach flavors. It's delicately structured, with a zingy strike of citrus acidity and hints of spice that carry long on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This semisweet Riesling balances an intensely fruit-forward profile of ripe yellow cherry and quince flavors against a backdrop of crisp, tart tangerine acidity. It's sunny and bright, yet elegantly composed, with a bristle of fresh herb notes that linger on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Opening with aromatic notes of smoke against a backdrop of stone fruit and apple blossoms, this is a racy little Riesling that packs a powerful punch of flavor. Delicately sweet, with a saturated palate of yellow cherry and quince, it's smartly balanced by a sheen of minerals and brisk, bracing citrus acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wisps of smoke and candle wax seem savory in contrast to the ripe stone fruit and lemon aromas on this concentrated Riesling. Ripe, juicy tangerine flavors lend sweetness to the palate, but are cut with a vein of lime acidity that reverberates from start to finish. It's delicately textured, yet chock full of vibe and zest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While remarkably lithe and delicate in style, this complex auslese is lusciously concentrated, with ripe peach and nectarine flavors balanced by hints of smoke, spice and musk. It's zippy and bright, with tart tangerine acidity and a wave of minerality on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very sweet, honeyed flavors mark this dessert wine. It has apricot, pear, lemon and vanilla richness, brightened by crisp acidity. It's absolutely delicious for drinking now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The low-yielding vineyards generate concentrated aromas and flavors of cantaloupe, yellow peach, elderberry, crushed tomato vine and exotic fruit. A juicy palate is supported by fresh acidity and the lingering finish ends on a mineral note. It's crisp and delicious now but still can develop more depth. Drink through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a small estate, this big, ripe and fruity wine has swathes of black fruits to go with the dark, brooding tannins. Very broad and fruity, the wine is always likely to be structured. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This complex, mature wine has plenty of red fruit flavors, but its main character displays concentrated, tannin and spice. Hints of leather and rich acidity add their notes to this dense, dusty wine. It is ready to drink although it will still mature until 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "White wines are rare in the Côte de Nuits and this wine is as structured as many reds. It does have strong toast flavors, a juicy citrus character and pear flavors. They go with an apple skin and spice aftertaste, laced with acidity. Drink until 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich blackberry and chocolate form around chalky tannins and a juicy palate, with a waft of cigar in the distance. Medium bodied, round and soft, the finish is brushed in cherry and pomegranate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tim Knappstein's decision to focus on the Adelaide Hills bears fruit in this terrific-value Pinot Noir. The aromas and flavors are a colorful mélange of beets, black cherries and purple heirloom tomatoes, backed by a rich texture and a long velvety finish. Drink now until 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Stewed prune marinated in spirits, coconut, espresso and grilled herb aromas unfold in the glass. The firm palate offers dark cherry, coffee, anise and tobacco alongside bracing tannins bright acidity. Best after 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A strongly wood aged wine, powered by tannins and dense fruits, it is concentrated and still young enough for the wood to show through although the fruit is developing well. This is a structured wine that will need plenty of time to age so drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This nose is rather closed but the firm palate offers ripe sour cherry, dark cooking spice, pipe tobacco and chopped herb. Fresh acidity and youthfully austere but refined tannins provide the backbone. Drink after 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Vanilla, black-cherry soda and a berry crème brûlée character combine for a very playful and fun nose on this bottling. The palate tightens up that fun a bit but stays sexy, offering dark chocolate, red-berry jam and a shred of mint.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Stainless-steel fermented, this wine remains pungently aromatic in woody, earthy tones, with accents of fragrant orange blossom and pear, while staying crisp and light on the palate. Honey and lemon combine on the complex finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Classic Nebbiolo aromas of red berry, underbrush, tilled soil, aromatic herb and spice lead the nose. The bracing palate offers dried black cherry, anisette, mocha, toast and grilled herb alongside extremely assertive tannins and brisk acidity. Drink 2019–2031.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of red berry, sage, cinnamon and a whisper of menthol lead the nose and carry over to the solid palate together with juicy sour cherry, black raspberry, licorice and tobacco. It's a classic Barolo, straightforward and delicious, with ripe, integrated tannins and fresh acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with aromas of woodland berry, crushed herb and a whiff of well-integrated oak. The firm palate delivers dried Morello cherry, baking spice and mocha alongside firm, fine-grained tannin. It closes on a note of star anise. Drink 2016–2021 to capture the fruit richness.\n",

      "This wine is all about juicy blackberry and delicious ripe black plums. It is structured, with dry tannins in the background, but up front is fruity, bold and with a lightly smoky, perfumed aftertaste. It is almost ready to drink; just wait until late 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Vineyards in the upper Douro Superior region are able to produce surprisingly fresh and fruity whites like this, despite the heat and dry climate. Old vines go into this yellow and green fruit flavored wine with its lively acidity and totally refreshing palate. Drink from summer 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Though 28 g/L of residual sugar is indicated, this lushly fruity and thoroughly delicious wine does not seem at all sweet, and just barely off dry. Peaches and pears combine in a lightly spicy but intensely flavorful wine with a myriad of food pairing possibilities, notably Thai noodle dishes, or poultry with a fruit sauce.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a floral blend of 48% Roussanne, 35% Marsanne and 17% Viognier. The Roussanne speaks loudest, while the whole offers a mix of dried and fresh apricot and creamy vanilla wafer that's light bodied and fresh with acidity.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Delicate whiffs of tangerine and lime intensify on the palate of this Spätlese Riesling, complemented by swathes of green herb and pine frond. It's superlight in texture, yet penetrating, showering the palate in sweet-tart grapefruit and Meyer lemon flavors. The finish is crisp and clean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "Dark and brooding, this opens with aromas of French oak, espresso, clove and mature blackberry. On the extracted palate, licorice, vanilla and sweet baking spice accent a core of baked plum while bracing, fine-grained tannins provide the framework.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This appealing, youthful wine wraps bright raspberry fruit in a fragrant blanket of toasty oak. It's lively, detailed and impeccably fresh, with the balance to age gracefully through at least 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big red fruit embraces chewy, integrated tannins in this vineyard-designate, a full-bodied explosion of ripeness and bold expression. While powerful, it holds on to nuance via streaks of high-toned citrus, allowing the wine room to breathe and remain lighthearted.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% Dijon-clone bottling offers a bold mix of peach, banana and pineapple. It's fruit-driven from top to bottom, with supporting acids to keep it fresh and invigorating.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of baked plum are joined by earthy whiffs of truffle, leather, game and cured meat. The aromas carry over to the ripe, dense palate along with fleshy black cherry, anise, mocha and mint. Velvety tannins provide the framework while a confectionary note backs up the finish. Drink 2017–2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Alluring aromas of violet, rose, dark berry and a hint of cured meat emerge on this firmly structured wine. The palate is rather extracted, offering rich black cherry, chocolate, tobacco and sweet spice alongside grippy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Waves of French oak, coconut, espresso and menthol lead the nose. The dense, extracted palate offers raspberry jam, vanilla, toasted oak and kirsch alongside packed, fine-grained tannins. The warmth of alcohol and a leathery note signal the finish. Nebbiolo purists may find the new wood sensations excessive but if you're into concentrated, oak-driven wines, you'll especially enjoy this.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This crisp, delicate Pinot Noir should be consumed over the next few years for its elegant cherry and rose petal notes and silky tannins. Hints of scorched earth and dry leaves add extra interest to the reasonably complex bouquet.\n",

      "This lightweight, fruity wine is very direct in its acidity and canteloupe flavors. Citrus cuts the richness, while a fine chalky texture comes from the soil of the region. It's a wine to drink soon, fresh and packed with crisp fruits.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cherry and plum aromas are earthy, gritty and not overly potent. The palate is saturated, with the right amount of body weight and volume. There's a blitz of berry and black cherry flavors, backed by a finish that's black in nature and shows mild bitter notes of chocolate and coffee.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Totally herbaceous, it's full of green herb flavors and tight with citrus and gooseberry. A light touch balances the intensity, giving freshness to the wine that's ready to drink now.\n",

      "A red Meritage blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 4% Malbec, the name honors Dry Creek Vineyard's love of seafaring. With a nod to the Old World, it's lean and savory in black tea and exotic herb. Juicy, brambly berry come to the fore on the finish, which is still grippy on the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A complex aromatic profile of the fruit, spice and savory elements found in plum chutney, this promising wine drops off a bit once sipped. But it is still tasty, with freshly picked plum flavors bringing fruit, tartness and tannins together, a bit of bacon fat on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine has both fruitiness and delicious, bright acidity. A subtle use of wood creates a firm structure under the black currant fruit flavors, giving a solid base on which to develop. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fuller in style, it boasts layers of coconut cream pie, fig and honey, with a swirl of vanilla lurking in there too. Mineral-rich, the finish revisits the creamy, baked fruit theme, lush and generous.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with aromas of plum, exotic spice and incense. The palate displays black cherry accented with white and black pepper, leather, licorice, espresso and balsamic notes but astringent tannins cut this short.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big and flashy, it has oodles of almost sweet oak and ripe fruit character. Full-bodied, rich in texture, with ripe raspberry and red cherry flavors, it offers firm tannins and a lingering, vanilla scented finish.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "From old vines planted on the Mayacamas Mountains, this Gewurz is pungent in lychee and grapefruit, a trace of pepper, ginger and clove hiding beneath the surface. Medium-bodied and dry, it offers a rich interplay between herb and spice plus freshness on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This fragrant wine is full of fresh citrus and green apple flavors that are crisp and lively. A steely element comes through to give structure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "One of the many estate Pinot Noirs produced by the pioneering Arroyo Grande Valley winery, which was founded as a sparkling wine house, this offers scents of sandalwood, black licorice and red currant. The flavors are tart with cranberry, then bring some bitter notes of crushed herbs.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Potent and pungent, it holds juicy acids tasting of grapefruit. It plunges into a chocolaty midpalate with strawberry fruit that thins into light flavors of soda pop.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light and brigh, it comes from tSanta Barbara County grape-growing pioneer Louis Lucas. Aromas of orange juice, passionfruit and sugared grapefruit peel create a strong introduction. On the floral-laced palate, pear cider and night jasmine flavors make for a solid sipper if not particularly complex.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Croatian white is a blend of Debit, Pošip, Marastina, Pinot Grigio and Chardonnay. It has heady aromas of dried fruits, fresh peaches and buttered toast. There are great flavors of fresh stone fruits and black figs in the midpalate, and a pleasantly astringent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This retro-styled wine displays its new-wood influence. It opens with aromas of coconut, oak extract, coffee and espresso that continue onto the palate along with a hint of mint and spice. But there's not enough fruit richness to support the evident oak and drying wood tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light, bright and refreshing, it offers pear spritzer, lime zest and a hint of guava on the nose, followed by citrus rind, light papaya and apple juice on the palate. It makes a nice bridge between the richness of Chardonnay and crispness of Sauvignon Blanc.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An aromatic wine, it has a rounded texture, a spicy character and only light acidity. Very forward and fruity, it's going to be ready to drink by 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "It balances a crisp texture against ripe fruitiness. Finely structured, it's very fresh with herbaceous fruits and lively acidity. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "At this stage, the wine is closed, just hinting at its rich, fruity future. It has good acidity and a touch of bitter almonds, but the real fruitiness is still to come. Wait until 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A collaboration between winemaker Nick Goldschmidt and his daughter Chelsea, this 100% Merlot delivers great value. Oaky in plummy black fruit and tobacco, it shows a touch of cedar and clove amidst mountainous tannins. An ideal wine for pepper steak off the grill.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "White currants and fresh apricots dominate this fruity, fragrant wine. Bright acidity is enveloped by the generous texture and touch of toast. This rich wine is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The best of the winery's 2011 block reserves, this displays a solid core of cherry fruit, augmented with some streaks of steel and stone. It's firm and tannic, with plenty of tart acidity behind the crisp fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This longtime Carneros producer sources from dozens of its own blocks to put together this estate Chardonnay. Intense in floral aromas as well as peach and lemon, it's dusted only slightly in clove and a light barrel imprint. Bright on the tongue and on the finish, it's a food-friendly wine that will complement.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Silky in cherry and strawberry with a dense midpalate of refined oak, this delicately hued Pinot comes from a single, hillside block of Cuvaison's Carneros property. With pretty aromas of violet and rose, it has richness that isn't overdone, a nice expression of the appellation's power and finesse.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A cherry-fresh wine that's so full of fruit that its structure becomes secondary. A dry edge of tannin supports the fruit and acidity, making this wine so drinkable now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plum and berry aromas are pure and compact. This is a lively, energetic, everyday Tempranillo with lots of bounce to its step. The power-packed palate is full of mixed berry flavors, while the finish is dense and comfortable, with residual weight.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoke and oak pronounce themselves vigorously on the nose and entry of this 100% varietal wine, which holds on with a tight grip. Black fruit dominates with leather, chocolate and tobacco playing secondary roles. The finish is lengthy and powerful.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In a small field of excellent Cavas, this bready, leesy, semi-rich bottling stands out for its totality and comfort on the palate. Along the road are aromas of burnt banana and toasted bread along with flavors of arugula, lime and dried apple. An elegant finish with stone-fruit and green-herb notes is sophisticated.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Bulgarian Mavrud from Elenovo has aromas of blackberry, freshly brewed coffee, espresso bean, spice and a whiff of eucalyptus. It has flavors of blackberry, blueberry and black plums with rounded tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Entirely sourced from this Sangiacomo family-farmed vineyard, which is planted entirely to the Old Wente clone, this wine offers fleshy and tropical juiciness and texture. Aged in French oak, the vast majority of it neutral, the wine lets the fruit and acidity speak for themselves.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the renowned vineyard's F Block comes a wine with plump wild berries, pencil lead and juniper on a tightly woven nose. Certain to last for years and evolve steadily over that time, the palate now shows lavender, elderberry, elderflower, cranberry essence and a touch of black tea. Drink 2018–2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cherry-rhubarb juice, shiitake mushrooms, sagebrush and iron make for a lush and layered nose on this appellation-blend wine that is widely available. The palate begins with plush red cherry then dives into oregano, sage and mace spice. It's expertly complex for a reasonably priced wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe bramble and smoked nuts cast a savory edge to concentrated blackberry and cherry flavors in this robust wine. It's velvety and rich, but crisp, cranberry acidity and a granite edge lend elegance. Drink now through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich, ripe streaks of black cherry preserve are balanced by savory nuances of dried herb, toast and bramble in this luscious Pinot Noir. Aptly “lusty” in style, it's deeply concentrated with an unabashed fruit-forwardness, but crisp cranberry acidity and a penetrating earthiness gives it marked composure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hailing from Olsen and Elephant Mountain vineyards, this wine brings black currant, huckleberry and dark plum aromas that smell pure and sweet. The black fruit and smoke flavors display a mixture of concentration and restraint.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Scorched earth, toasted nut, espresso, cured meat and baked plum aromas lead the nose on this concentrated wine along with a hint of new leather. The big, chewy palate doles out mature black cherry, pomegranate, licorice and tobacco while tightly knit, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink 2019–2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is sourced from a handful of stellar vineyards, including Pratt, Dutton, Sullivan and Chenoweth. It was given 18 months in French oak, all of it twice-used or older, which contributes to an integrated, understated wood presence that's refreshing in its restraint. Creamy acidity and a taste of baked bread cradles lemon zest and almond before a crisp, lengthy finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Leafy underbrush, scorched earth, porcini mushroom and dried plum aromas lead the nose. The firmly structured palate offers dried black cherry, raspberry confiture and licorice alongside assertive, tightly-packed tannins. Drink 2018–2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of fruit from the McGinley and Grassini vineyards, this wine is fermented in oak barrels, yielding a nose that's an approachable buffet of nectarine, wet cement, chopped lemongrass and wet hay. The oak also gives the palate more weight to deliver flavors of green-apple slices, kumquat, lime zest and cut lawn.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deep, dark blueberry fruit meets with beef char, fudge chocolate and espresso-bean notes on the nose of this blend of 59% Petite Sirah, 15% Syrah, 14% Tannat, 7% Petit Verdot, 4% Grenache and 1% Viognier. The rigid tannins need a little more time to open, but the zesty blueberry, blackberry and black-pepper flavors shine across the fresh, sizzling acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe fruit and oak loom large in this wine, produced from relatively old vines in the heart of the appellation, long a source for the producer's Pinot Noir. Preserved lemon, fleshy melon and caramel dance around each other, steeped in Golden Delicious apple, honey and pear. A high wire of acidity marks the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This comes in at 15g/L residual sugar, but it's more than offset with mineral-drenched acidity, so it drinks like a dry wine. Pale lemon in hue, it offers citrus flesh and rind in a young, yeasty, medium-bodied wine. The persistent, crisply-defined finish leaves a pleasing aftertaste of tangerine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plummy chocolate stars in this densely textured yet nicely lean wine, which finds balance and power in the glass. Cherry, blueberry and cedar make appearances, before a finish kissed in tobacco.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Boosted with 5% Barbera, this bottling for the estate's Bootjack Ranch shows ripe cranberry, red cherry, a pinch of herbs and touches of caramel and coffee syrup on the nose. A dense core of black plum skins at the palate's core is surrounded by bright cherry fruit, evolving into a dark chocolate and espresso touch.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This vineyard-designated estate wine is restrained and elegant, allowing for a sparkle of raspberry and black cherry to speak. The oak is light and integrated, and the minerality well defined, with just the smallest traces of black licorice and pepper coming through on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tangy and intensely vibrant in citrus, this site-specific white sings in grapefruit pith and zest, layering those flavors atop spicy ginger and herb. It finishes bright and fresh on the palate, eager for food.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cabernet Sauvignon makes up just over half of this blend with the rest Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Vanilla and cocoa aromas are out in front of herb, black licorice and dark fruit. The dark-fruit and woodspice flavors are refined and show a sense of depth, elegance and balance that captures the attention.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Amber gold in the glass, this Ribolla Gialla has aromas of wet river rocks, vanilla bean and honeycomb. It has a luscious mouthfeel with pronounced minerality and flavors of apricot, apple and ripe pear.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Not just an intriguing wine that geeks will love to find, this bottling of Charbono is intriguing and accessible to lovers of many different styles. Rich but fruity aromas of boysenberry, black plum, hoisin sauce and wood smoke give way to a palate laced with more plum and rounded purple fruit as well as touches of graphite and gravel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sunbaked earth, mature black-skinned fruit, menthol, dark spice and a whiff of cured meat aromas emerge in the glass. The ripe, concentrated palate offers dried black cherry, star anise and tobacco alongside mature, densely packed tannins. Drink 2018–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh and creamy, this delicious wine shows a fruit mix of melon, apple and pear, with just a hint of celery. It's balanced and crisp, with excellent penetration and length.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mounds of decadent chocolate and cassis round out a smoothly textured wine dotted in dried herb and black olive, coming together in firm tannin and integrated acidity. The finish is leathery.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This amontillado smells complete, with a tight aromatic mix of raw wood, brine, citrus and dried stone fruits. The palate is racy, with razor-like acidity. Intense flavors of dried apricot, tart nectarine and almond skins finish full  and lasting, with cutting acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of scorched earth, game, truffle and mature plum come together in the glass. The ripe palate offers dried blackberry, mature cherry, anise and almond alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Chocolaty aromas and ample spicy, dark-fruit flavors power this generous and firm-textured wine. Everything seems in place and in balance, ready to take on a nice roast or braise.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is pretty pale for a Tavel, with a coppery tinge to its pink color. Notes of lime zest, wet stone and modest cherry-berry notes finish on a bright citrus note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This red blend is nicely dry, with abundant of dark plum and pomegranate flavors and a full-bodied, moderately tannic mouthfeel. It's easy to drink but bold enough to pair with hearty proteins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine opens softly, with faint aromas of lemon-lime citrus and lean green fruit. The medium-weight palate offers a bit more concentration in green plum and lime tones, finishing pithy and somewhat bitter.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This uniquely tan-colored Torrontés is “orange” in style. Aromas of orange peel, peach, apricot and floor polish are challenging but complex. This immediately turns grabby and astringent on the palate, while stone-fruit and pithy flavors are short, quick and dry.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Gritty aromas of herbal berry fruits and coffee grounds lead to a hard tannic, compact palate with loud acidity. Disparate flavors of burnt coffee, tomato and stewed plum finish with scraping tannins and herbal notes that reflect the nose and palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with scents of green melon rind, strawberry hull and lime that carry through to the palate alongside an additional note of peach. A pleasant grassy tone gives interest to the finish, while ample acidity keeps the palate fresh and clean. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While light in color, this wine is flavorful and easy to enjoy. Its smoothly textured, medium-bodied palate carries generous red cherry and plum flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This pale rosé blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is fruity with crisp strawberry fruits and acidity. It has a soft perfumed aftertaste that makes it immediately attractive. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the second label from this Gaillac estate. It is a fine mix of red fruits and spice—all fruitiness and with a strong shot of acidity. The wine is made to be drunk young; enjoy this summer.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A hint of maple syrup in the aromas and flavors gives this medium-bodied red a touch of sweetness. Oak flavors dominate the modest fruit on the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 30% Pinot Noir and 70% Gamay, this is a fruity wine with the softest tannins and red cherry flavor. Made to drink young, it's somewhat spoiled by a banana-like edge that comes from its vinification.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This informal red has a shy nose that eventually reveals whiffs of black-skinned fruit and a suggestion of cooking spice. The simple palate delivers black cherry and vanilla alongside laid-back tannins. Drink soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a light wine with plenty of acidity and soft tannins that come together in a juicy, crisp, red fruit-flavored medley. Ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A light orange pink color sets the scene for a fruity wine that has raspberry flavors, soft acidity and an attractive, crisp aftertaste. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Named after the series of vineyard terraces that rise steeply from the Lot river, this wine is soft and easily accessible. It does have the Malbec structure although this is comfortably balanced by the black fruit and acidity. The wine will be ready to drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh grass, gooseberry, lime leaf and a touch of melon rind appear on the nose and mouth of this straightforward wine. It's lightweight and easygoing, with brisk acidity and a crisp, refreshing finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine veers slightly sweet, like many overripe red blends. It's deep in color, soft in and makes a good counterpoint to spicy foods.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is bold for a boxed wine, showing ripe, lightly spicy flavors supported by a firm and moderately tannic texture. It's nearly dry, too.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raspy berry and plum aromas lead to a palate dominated by tartaric acid. That, in turn, leads to sharp berry and plum flavors backed by a bracing finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with aromas of resin and a whiff of dried flower that follow through to the lean palate along with hints of citrus and dried stone fruit. But it's cut short by extremely bitter sensations that recall walnut skin.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Basic white-fruit aromas are a bit dusty and yeasty. This feels plump, soft and creamy, with bitter-leaning green melon and papaya flavors. Notes of onion and grape skins rise up on the finish. This is a mix of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Viognier.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an earthy blend of Touriga Nacional, Jaen and Trincadeira. Unencumbered by wood aromas, it's full of structured red berry fruit and balanced acidity and is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is soft and accessible now, with plush notes of baked apple, creamed pear and oaky spice on the attack. The medium-weight palate is broad in feel, begging for a bit more lift to the rich fruit and buttered toast flavors. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Narrow berry aromas are angular and punchy. This feels high in acidity, with hard tannins. That sharp acidity makes for tart unyielding black plum flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An aromatic opening of compost and vinegar might suggest casting this aside. But flavors of strawberry and chocolate, along with an admitted weedy note, amount to something decent. Finishing notes of brown sugar and berry syrup are chocolaty and ensure that this finishes better than it begins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a fresh and lively white, with some green bean and herbaceous notes to support the core of gooseberry and lime rind aromas and flavors. It's light and straightforward, but clean and so easy to enjoy. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Already a bit light in color and showing some rust at the rim, this medium-weight, silky-textured wine features aromas of sun-baked clay and cherries. There's not much depth or richness, but the tart fruit makes for an easy quaff. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Pinot Noir-heavy sparkler opens with aromas of briny citrus and bready yeast. The palate is fresh and low on weight, with a dominating flavor of pink grapefruit. Overall, this is basic but easy to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a simple, tart red, crisp in cranberry and red currant fruit and perfumed with spicy oak. Despite the high acidity on the front palate, it hangs heavy in full-bodied ripeness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This straw-colored Chardonnay has aromas of apple and citrus blossom with flavors of creamy apple, vanilla and citrus pith. It has nice weight on the palate with a clean acidic finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A clean nose of citrus paves the way for flavors of grapefruit and Sevilla orange. This wine is soft and pleasing on the palate, but it may be touch tart for some tastes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Seduction may be an odd word to use for a Malbec-based wine that is dark and drily tannic. It is structured and firm, with a dry core and black currant fruits. Drink this solid wine from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Concentrated aromas of blackened oak, blackberry, cassis, licorice and hickory smoke are clarion calls that this is a fully oaked, modern wine. In the mouth, it's heavy and tannic but doesn't trip over itself. Blackberry, cassis, burnt toast and campfire flavors finish equally toasted, peppery, charred and lemony, with chewy tannins. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With fresh green-apple aromas, and juicy apple and citrus flavors, this is a lively, crisp and well-balanced wine. Instead of going for overt oaky, buttery flavors and a fat mouthfeel, it stays nicely lean and refreshing, even with relatively full body.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Coming from a vineyard near Solvang, this wine by Mikael Sigouin shows orange sponge cake, honey and the slightest twist of petrol on the nose. The palate boasts orange blossoms and bright acidity, gaining complexity from chalky white rocks and the slight bitterness of Japanese pear peels.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Slightly oxidized aromas of marzipan, pressed yellow flowers, dried lemon rinds and apricot cream entice the nose on this wine from the historic vineyard by Joshua Klapper. The palate shows woody spice and a unique iodine character, with cinnamon, salt, sour yeastiness and a touch of tart citrus peel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A hint of honey gives this wine richness while keeping every bit of freshness. It has tangy acidity, a mineral character and apricot and mango fruit flavors. Drink now, although the wine will be better from early 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rick Longoria's light winemaking touch even plays into this Spanish grape, which is daintier than regional counterparts. Red and Bing cherries mix with purple flowers, some dried fruit and vanilla paste on the nose. The palate leans herbal, with anise and chopped Italian herbs, also showing brick minerality and oak on the finish. The wine would definitely shine brighter with food.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah come together to offer scents of red currant, toast, cedar and spice. It's firm and savory, with notes of white pepper, aniseed and dried aromatic herbs alongside assertive tannins. Drink 2016–2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A black plum-extract character marks the nose of this wine from the folks behind Los Angeles' historic San Antonio Winery, but it's brown spice that dominates, particularly uncrushed cloves and anise seeds. Dried sour cherry and uncracked peppercorns show on the palate that is presented on rather chewy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blueberry, chocolate, mint and clove aromas lead the nose of this blend of 50% Syrah, 35% Cabernet Franc and 15% Petit Verdot. The palate offers dried black cherries, coffee, cinnamon, black pepper and cocoa. Fine-grained tannins provide the framework.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Solid berry and cassis aromas are a touch baked on the nose. This is firm, moderately tannic on the palate, with baked plum, blackberry, vanilla and spice flavors. A woody note of maple gains prominence on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full bodied and bold flavored, this is not overwhelmingly dark in color nor pumped up in ripeness. It does emphasize aromas of anise and dried plums, adding flavors of blackberrry juice and a sense of alcoholic strength. It is moderately tannic, while the texture is mouthfilling and the finish rather warm.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "One barrel was new French oak, the other neutral. The cranberry fruit here is subdued and tart, while the barrel aging brings in popcorn, walnuts and even a trace of butter brickle. Give this bottle until 2017–2017 to open up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fruity and almost off dry, this appealing wine goes heavy on flavors of spicy pear and apricot jam. A streak of honey runs through, and a hint of wintergreen. It's already drinking well, so dive in.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This fruity, friendly Pinot opens with ripe berry aromas mixed with touches of minerality and latex. It feels fresh and sturdy, with black cherry and raspberry flavors. A pure, sweet, lightly chocolaty finish wraps things up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 25% Petit Verdot offers aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, blue flowers, vineyard dust and dark cooking spices. The firm palate delivers black currants, licorice, cinnamon, ground pepper and Mediterranean herbs. Bracing tannins offer support and leave an astringent, drying finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Creamy oak, herbal blackberry, vanilla and mild green notes make for an intriguing, spicy nose. A heavy, tannic palate brings the weight and thickness, while flavors of blackberry and boysenberry come with salty notes and a briny, herbal finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Despite the name, this is the value offering, not the reserve, from Soléna. Young, tart and tight, it displays primary fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, with sharp, lemony acids. Holding until 2016–2017 may help to smooth it out, but it's perfectly delightful already.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deep purple fruit aromas of dried blackberries and pressed plums benefit from a fresh dill edge as well as a umami element on the nose of this wine from the Rice family, which started making wine in 1990. The acidity and alcohol combine for a tongue-tantalizing sip, with flavors of black cherries and dark herbs.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made entirely from Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of green bell pepper, cedar and an herbaceous whiff of grass. The palate offers mature red currants, raspberries, exotic spice, toasted oak, herb and vanilla alongside bracing tannins. It has a tart, drying finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Brambly cassis and raspberry aromas are warm and a touch cooked. This is bullish, heavy and grabby in feel, with big tannins. Blackberry, cassis, herb and chocolate flavors finish ripe and dark. Drink through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Riesling remains the highlight of this value-oriented lineup, and it's now in a pretty floral package. Bright fruit flavors of orange, tangerine and apricot jam abound, with a clean and fresh mouthfeel. There's a hint of sweetness, but not enough to render it incompatible with most foods.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is 100% varietal, quite pretty in shades of pale pink, and perfectly dry without turning sour. Flavors of watermelon, pink grapefruit, rosewater and Jonathan apples all come into play. Drink it while the wine retains its youthful freshness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deep blueberry, prune and dried purple aromas are made even more delicious by hints of bacon fat on this blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 30% Syrah, 9% Mourvèdre and 1% Grenache. The vintner lives in the historic Uvas Valley between Gilroy and Morgan Hill. Purple fruit juiciness is balanced by a sharp licorice edge, framed by judicious acidity and tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of underbrush, black fruit, toast and espresso lead the nose on the blend of Sangiovese and 15% Malvasia Nera. The palate is still resting heavily on its oak, showing coffee, coconut, vanilla and mocha, along with dried black cherry, prune and clove. The raspy tannins need to soften up but the fruit richness is already drying up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a serious, wood-aged wine whose ripe fruits are dominated at the moment by heavy toast flavors. The fruit does offer weight and good potential, making it a structured, dark wine that is beginning to suggest a juicy future. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a herbal, earthy wine with as many tannins as fruit at this stage. That gives it a dense, dusty texture that seeps into the ripe, sweet plum flavors. With the wood giving an extra push of richness as well as spice, it needs to age. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "To judge by the weight of the bottle, this is regarded as an important wine by the producer. The wine inside is attractive and fruity, ripe with berry fruits and considerable freshness. The tannins give the power for the bottle, dry and dense at this young stage. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Briny aromas of bell pepper, jalapeño and canned pea are green-leaning but not overly vegetal. This has a round mouthfeel and ample body to absorb the wine's acidity, while flavors of celery, bell pepper, lime and tangerine come with a strong grassy accent and a persistent, briny tasting finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier (CSV). From estate vineyards in the Cahors region, it is a young wine, still developing its potentially aromatic character, fragrant acidity and rich pineapple and red apple flavors. Hold this wine and drink from late 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with aromas of toast, weedy underbrush and tobacco. The palate offers stewed plum marinated in spirits, anisette and coffee but not much fruit richness. Bracing tannins give it an astringent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pretty aromas of violet, rose and wild berry lead the nose. The bright but rather lean palate offers raw red berry, peppercorn and saline together with notes of dried sage. Astringent tannins create an abrupt finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas are dominated by oak with accents of vanilla, cocoa and woodspice along with cranberries, rose hips, herbs and raspberries. The palate is elegant with herb and cherry flavors that lead to a tart, cranberry-filled finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Warm and robust, this has aromas of underbrush, spiced plum, grilled sage, leather and a balsamic note. The tightly wound palate offers dried berry, fig, menthol and licorice alongside super-astringent tannins and the heat of alcohol. A note of roasted coffee bean signals the close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Though just five years old, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot already seems quite tired, with notes of leather, dried red fruit and mushroom taking the lead. It has a pleasing, silky feel but the tart fruit flavors seem past their prime.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big, fresh and juicy, this is a bright and forward wine. Attractive smoky tannins are layered with fresh acidity and black currant flavors. The wine is already attractive, although there are enough tannins for it to age. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is all fruit, crisp and with plenty of herbaceousness. A smoother character comes from the Sémillon in the blend that also gives richness. The wood aging shows only lightly, leaving fruitiness at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Produced from young vines, this is the third wine of Larrivet Haut-Brion. As such, it is very accessible with its ripe, red exuberant fruits. The tannins are in the background, giving the necessary structure to a wine that will age quickly. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The dryness and tannins of this wine are on the outside. Inside it has plenty of juicy fruit, sweet acidity and black plum flavors. Put the two together and this ripe wine offers plenty of potential. Drink from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hugely ripe Merlot is at the core of this rich wine. It is opulent, rounded and packed with dark plum-juice flavors. It verges on too much, too rich and too generous. What redeems it is the Bordeaux structure and final dry aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Nearly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine is perfumed in lavender and awash in juicy red cassis. The acidity is medium to high, while the tannins are rough and chewy, suggesting the need for assimilation time.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose isn't very expressive, but the palate offers mature blackberry, dried cherry, ground pepper, espresso and anise alonside assertive, astringent tannins. The dried fruit shows the heat of the vintage so best to drink soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Oodles of black cherry and boysenberry fill the aromas and flavors of this bold but not-too-big wine. The rich, ripe fruit shows right away in the nose, and continues on the palate but gets reined in a bit (in a good way) by a firm texture created by good acidity and tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Extremely fruity and rich, this stops just short of sweetness while delivering delicious cherry, mixed berry and plum flavors with just a touch of tannin and acidity to keep it fresh. It is quite full bodied and ready to drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% varietal wine offers aromas of fresh-ground coffee, chocolate, herbs and plum along with barrel accents. It's soft in feel with an elegant styling, trailing toward the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The 60% Cabernet in the blend gives a dark fruit character. At this young stage, the wood aging still dominates with its burnt toast and chocolate character. For the future, while the wine will be dry, it also has plenty of fresh fruit. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This single-vineyard wine offers wild blueberry with vanilla and herb accents. It's full bodied and high-octane in feel with the flavors running straight down the fairway.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Grass and gooseberry are prominent on the nose and palate in this crisp SB, bright in dialed-high acidity. That sense of vibrant freshness mellows somewhat midway through the wine, allowing it to finish with a lushness on the tongue.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Generous sweet-tasting oak flavor coats the fresh plum and red cherry flavors in this medium-bodied wine. It has a broad, velvety texture, and shows good balance between ripeness, acidity and firm tannins. It finishes with a soft touch.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine hails from Lawrence and Antoine Creek vineyards and was barrel-fermented in new French oak before being moved to stainless steel. It starts out quite reduced and then opens to show notes of peach, pear and mineral. It's rounded and lightly oily in feel, tapering on the back half.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tech sheets hint at Stagecoach Vineyard being involved somehow in this Syrah, a chewy expression of coconut, smoke and game around a dense, concentrated body and well-integrated tannins. The finish is all about mocha.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Predominantly Syrah (80%) with Petite Sirah and Viognier, this wine conveys raspberries, cherries, flowers, black pepper and dark coffee. It's lighter in style with lip-smacking fruit and barrel flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Half Malbec with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this wine shows the oak up front, with dill and vanilla leading over plum and green herbs. The fruit flavors are plump and generous backed by vibrant acidity. Barrel notes linger on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Brighter and fresher than usual for this varietal, this shows green apple, lime, lemon and melon aromas and flavors. With a tangy, refreshing balance, medium body and crisp texture, it is fun and refreshing to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This straightforward wine from the Riboli family portfolio goes down very easy, making it perfect for backyard barbecues. Cherries, dried rose petals and anise greet the nose. The palate isn't too complex, but delivers dark red fruits and pepper spices.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There are a lot of varieties in this blend, from Merlot, which makes up the majority, to handfuls of Syrah, Zinfandel and Petit Verdot. Sizable tannins wrap themselves around flavors of tobacco, juicy plum and oaky vanilla, finishing dry and ripe.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While the nose is delicate with faint hints of yellow plum and pear, the palate is surprisingly brawny and bold. Rich, buttery and voluminous, this wine showcases ripe citrus and apple flavors, but falls a bit short on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While delicately framed for its variety, this Gewürztraminer is concentrated with sunny tangerine and peach flavors. Delicate hints of smoke, spice and blossom accent the midpalate and linger on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This affordable, estate-vineyard 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is chewy in robust tar and leather, with companionable characteristics of cranberry and herb. The acidity is high-toned and the oak profile restrained.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Although light, this well-balanced wine has good depth. A dry core of tannins backs up the bright red berry and black currant fruits. Acidity and the tannins promise some aging, although the wine is drinkable now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here's a lively Moscato made in a dry style that opens with heady scents of jasmine, citrus blossom and yellow stone fruit aromas. The vibrant palate tastes of apricot, tangerine zest and a note of botanical herb alongside fresh acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crisp acidity and a gorgeous, aromatic nose lead on this elegant white. Though mineral-driven, it offers generous white peach and grapefruit flavors that will pair well with fuller-bodied fish. Impressive and versatile.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Among the well-differentiated single vineyard selections from Soléna in 2014, this may be the most instantly enjoyable. It's a big, mouth-coating wine, a full-flavored burst of chocolate-covered cherries. Lighter notes of coffee and tobacco filter in through the extended finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The oak in this wine is restrained, partly because it aged in stainless steel and a sizable percentage of neutral oak. Still, a richness of apple and pear compote provide a steady level of richness, while a lemon squeeze of acidity keeps it fresh and youthful.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of iris, rose, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of baking spice lead nose. The juicy, easy-drinking palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, black raspberry and black pepper alongside bright acidity and supple tannins. Chill this down for the perfect summer red.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of this wine show considerable wood. On the palate, the wood is very present, giving acidity as well as layers of toast and spice. Hints of yellow fruit show through, suggesting the possibility of a ripe, rich wine in the future. Drink from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A soft, stony scent of pebble and the faintest melon signals a fresh, clean wine. The palate plays these aromas out softly but also with precision. That stoniness lingers on the dry, gentle finish and the lasting flavor of fresh apple peel\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With tannins and new-wood flavors, this rich wine is also structured. A smoky character from the wood is shot through by perfumed red fruits. The aftertaste shows more of the wood flavors that need to integrate. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Subtle hints of ripe, winter-stored apple on the nose lead to an equally apple-dominated palate that shows soft pepper spice. A wonderful midpalate texture and baked-apple richness are countered by lemon freshness. This is very appetizing and cries out for soft cheeses.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "White summer blossoms and ripe green pears make for a fresh scent. The palate lifts these notions with bright lemon acidity. All is buoyed by some residual carbon dioxide. Drink soon while this is at its aromatic height.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offers heady aromas of honeysuckle, white stone fruit, dill, hay and a vegetal note that recalls tomato leaf. The tangy palate offers juicy grapefruit, white peach and honeydew melon while mouthwatering salinity provides depth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a sophisticated blend of tart yellow fruits with hints of cucumber, salad greens and lemon oil. Though 80% stainless steel fermented, the rest spent time in new oak. The mineral rich acids provide extra grip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a sanguine, full-bodied and nearly jammy wine, rich and plush in black and red fruit and a curious twist of beef jerky. Cedar and cranberry provide a crisper, more classical edge burnished on the palate in leathery black pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From 100% estate-grown grapes, and possessing 6.8 g/L of residual sugar, this wine is lovely in peach, pear and lemon, and quite voluptuous in texture, with a hint of spice. Pretty floral aromas of jasmine provide additional flourish and invitation, with the finish dry.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Enticing scents of cherry blossom, Spanish broom, crushed rock and Mediterranean herb lift out of the glass. The vibrant, tangy palate offers succulent nectarine, wild cherry, crushed strawberry and mineral alongside a backbone of lively acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Dead Arm is always firmly structured, making it one of the more challenging Shiraz to judge in its youth. The 2010 is full-bodied and chewy, characterized by dark, earthy and umami notes of roasted meat, asphalt and grilled mushrooms. The length and ripely tannic nature of the finish is reassuring. Drink 2018–2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Chocolate and blackberry form an impressively generous and full-bodied personality in this 100% varietal wine aged 22 months in a hearty percentage of new oak. Big tannin and traces of cigar and espresso continue on the brawny theme.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An earthy wine that offers complexity around a full-bodied juiciness of blackberry and bitter black tea, this is made in a big style and will appeal to fans of concentration and decisive use of oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Opulent blackberry aromas and a mouthful of jammy, grapey but dry fruit flavors put a lot of oomph into this focused, concentrated and well-balanced wine. It is just tart and tannic enough to pair easily with rich food, and those same qualities should help it mellow with age through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This full-bodied and densely textured wine has a deep color, aromas like wood smoke and blackberries, and flavors that saturate the palate with berries, clove and dark chocolate notes. It's bold in body, has plenty of tannins for grip, and a lingering, rich finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A winning combination of seductive, spicy aromas and generous, well-developed fruit flavors make this wine hard to resist. It is full-bodied, dry and quite full-flavored, but without overdoing anything, so it's well balanced.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Allowing Zinfandel to take the 60% lead in this marriage with Cabernet Sauvignon, this is an impressive mingling of the two. Black pepper, clove and leathery cigar fuel a high-powered succulence of black and red fruit accented by a smoky drawl.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Generous fruit and spice flavors and a full, chewy mouthfeel make this an appetizing wine to pair with big food. It smells like black cherries, tastes ripe and berry-like and has accents of cinnamon and cardamom. The texture is supportive and lightly astringent, with fine tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spicy, herbal plum and cassis aromas mix in notes of olive and wet dog fur. This is more spunky and fresh than dense. Leafy berry, plum and olive are the key flavors on this Carmenère-led blend that finishes herbal and spicy, with high-toned residual acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoky, oaky, charred flavors of savory plum and berry lead to a full, layered palate with slightly abrasive tannins. This tastes of grilled beef, lemon peel, toast, cassis and chocolate. A toasted character remains on a solid finish. Drink through 2020.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Produced from the rare Romorantin grape, this wine is honeyed as well as crisp and fragrantly fruity. The 50-year-old vines give extra concentration to this lightly wood-aged wine that is ripe while also light and poised. Drink now, although it would be better to keep it until 2017.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Winemaker Mark McNeilly from Mark Ryan Winery makes this estate grown Viognier, and works it in the same strong, substantial, concentrated style as his own release.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A stellar wine at Kiona for decades, this includes 11% Gewürztraminer in the blend, and is finished at 83 g/L residual sugar.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Jet-black aromatics of creosote, charred meats, pepper and plum-blackberry jam make an excellent entry point for this wine from a vineyard in the new Ballard Canyon appellation.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Many red wines from Epiphany, run by the family of the late actor Fess Parker, have a nose-tickling singed-cedar aroma.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the second vintage release for the estate vineyard, which occupies the highest planted portion of Red Mountain. Precise, sharp-edged, high-acid red-fruit flavors of berry and cherry seem stacked vertically, with a strong mineral underpinning. The alcohol is a bit high, but overall the structure holds together and would support further aging; drink now–2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An aromatic profile of crushed mint, hot gravel and red fruit introduces this blend of 83% Grenache and 17% Mourvèdre. It's lightweight on the palate, but with complex flavors of herb and spice that swirl around a core of blackberry fruit and finish with mouthwatering acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the first vintage for this blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Sangiovese. Ripe, lush and complex, it offers flavors of plum and cassis, with an appealing texture and moderately gripping tannins. There's life and snap to the finish, and though it's already delicious just two years after the vintage, another year or two of bottle age should see it continue to improve.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is balanced and elegant in subtle pear, ginger and lemon. A fine food wine, it's ideal for roast chicken in herbes de Provence or ratatouille. Located in the Petaluma Gap and the source of grapes for several wines, Sun Chase was bought in 2013 by Guarachi Family Wines.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This cloudy, amber-colored wine isn't for the faint of heart. Made from ancient Grecanico, Carricante and Catarratto vines on the slopes of Mt. Etna and aged in terra cotta amphorae, it's mineral-driven with intense flint, smoke, nectarine, citrus, ginger, white pepper and balsamic sensations supported by an acidic backbone.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a wonderfully balanced wine, bursting with ripe spice as well as acidity. It's a rich wine, now showing maturity without losing its fruit. The depth of flavor, drilling right down to the mineral structure, is impressive. Drink now, although also wait until 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The color of this Malbec and the legs it gives off help separate it from the pack. A plush nose shows unabsorbed oak and char along with deep berry and cassis notes. Total saturation on the palate matches the nose, and this tastes of chocolate, mocha, wood spice and rich berry fruits. Oak is currently speaking the loudest on the finish. Drink through 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The floral perfume of this cool-climate bottling is intense—all lavender accented with black pepper, white pepper and thyme.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an impressively ripe and solidly fruity wine. Blending mainly Tannat with Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, it is certainly structured. But it is the brilliant black fruit that gives this wine its real character and density. It is impressive, and obviously made for the long haul. Drink from 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bob Lindquist shows his mastery of cool-climate fruit with this bottling, which is redolent of asphalt, cracked black pepper, rosemary, lavender and damson plum. It's fairly light in body but strong in tarry structure, offering loads of cracked peppercorn flavor with its juicy purple fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This feral and gamy wine shows roast lamb, rosemary, dried fennel, rose petal and forest floor aromas on its dynamic nose. The palate leads with explosive acidity, before waves of Concord grape and blackberry flavor take hold.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This lightly wood-aged wine, from an estate that has only changed hands three times in 400 years, is crisp, tight and very young. It has fine potential for the future. There are elegant fruits, spice and intense acidity that needs to soften. Produced from selected high-altitude parcels, the wine is balanced between the tangy texture and mineral fruitiness. Drink from early 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The estate wine from this Cahors showpiece property, it shows the rich intensity that can be conjured from Malbec, packed with tannins but also with dark, ripe-berry fruit and great intensity. It is a wine with potential—with a tannic structure that will see the wine starting to drink from 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Named after the year 2008, when Provence's La Londe became its own appellation, the wine is an impressive selection from specific parcels in the dry coastal slip between Toulon and Saint-Tropez.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The top cuvée from Roubine, this unusual blend of Tibouren and Clairette is intensely perfumed and ripe and with a fine stylish character. It is an impressive wine with yellow fruits as well as red currant and citrus. This food friendly wine should age a bit, so drink from late 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Daou brothers have become increasingly known for their rich, unctuous and lavish high-end wines, but this bottling offers a taste of that opulence for just $30. Plump blueberry and soft, cedar-like spice scents show on the nose, while the palate bursts with black cherry, dark chocolate and caramel flavors, powered by ample acidity. It will age gracefully, but is already delicious.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the producer's estate vineyard on Mount Veeder, this 100% varietal vineyard designate is oaky, viscous and intensely flavored with green apple, melon and peach. Delicious honeysuckle and grapefruit peel aromas make it all the more compelling, balancing its voluptuous weight and ripeness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From an aptly named vineyard, this whopper of a wine blends 37% Zinfandel, 32% Syrah, 16% Grenache and 15% Mourvèdre with 24% new oak and 20% whole-cluster fermentation. The result is a perfume that's both tart with boysenberry and rich with caramel, oak and cola. Black plum, gravel and bay leaf flavors surround its meaty core, persisting deep into the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "The first vintage of this small-production wine, this is meaty, full of smoky pepper and dense red and blue fruit. It's powerfully built and structured, packing a finishing punch of roasted coffee and chocolate flavors. A worthwhile new discovery and a producer to watch.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Domaine is the winery's top Pinot Noir: all-estate grown, from grapes now certified biodynamic. It's an accessible, pretty wine, with rich flavors of pastry fillings—think raspberry scones. It's got a tart, tangy grip and the length and structure to age at least a decade.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Flawless on the nose, this amontillado purchased from the solera of Señor González Obregón is full of lift, power and toffee on the nose. There's zero excess weight to the palate, which features flavors of nuts, salt, caramel and dried apricot. On the finish, a hint of buttered toast offers an umami offset to acid-driven raciness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Textural and beautifully detailed, this offers front-loaded flavors of cola, cocoa, graphite and tobacco, wrapped around blackberry and black-cherry fruits. Despite the relatively steep alcohol, this drinks in a lighter, more elegant, yet quite showy style.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made entirely from Chardonnay grapes grown in one site, the inaugural vintage of this cuvée is delicious. It offers a rich core of almond paste flavor, with inviting peach, apple and pear fruit tones, all while remaining light, bright and highlighted with wet stone and gravel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine comes from a parcel of land planted with both Merlot and Tannat. In its structure, this great wine has a strong connection to the Madirans that are the hallmark of this producer. With maturity, the wine has developed fine secondary flavors and undergrowth and dried-fruit flavors. The wine, named after a standing stone found in the area, is very ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the cool plains of the Petaluma Gap, this wine shines in violet and blueberry crumble aromas. Light bodied, it reveals deeper, darker pepper steak-like flavors as it opens, finishing on an elegant aftertaste of clove.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This modern-style Tempranillo is registering at max ripeness. Aromas of black fruits, raisin, tire rubber and toasty French oak project a dark outlook. In the mouth, this is tight and gripping. Flavors of blackened oak, cassis and blackberry finish firm and closed, with manageable tannins. Drink through 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bryan Babcock heads to Bentrock Vineyard on the southwestern edge of the appellation to deliver this wine redolent of red cherry, plum, mulberry, peppery spice and sagebrush. The palate is rich and full bodied, with tangy red plum skin and eucalyptus touches, finishing on a fresh, menthol-like note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is one of the most beloved Chardonnays from Santa Barbara County, and for good reason: Bryan Babcock manages to imbue his wine with buttery richness yet also balance it with acidity and smoke. Honeysuckle, almond and Gravenstein apple aromas lead into energetic yet creamy marshmallow and poached pear flavors, all cut with citrusy acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Unusual aromatics conjure ruby red grapefruit, Douglas fir needles, green tea and a touch of cola. The site, which is rather cool, fills in the main palate with grapes offering sleek subtle flavors of mountain berry.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This herb-laced wine comes from a 1,100-feet elevation outpost five miles from the ocean and shows both feral notes and robust fruit. Tart cranberry flavor dominates, complemented by orange peel nuances. Its tannins are in full force, calling for more time in the glass if not in the cellar. Best the second day after opening, if one can wait.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This hearty and heavily spiced take on the grape offers fascinating black cherry, cardamom, chai spice and sanguine, meaty scents on the nose. The flavors may strike some palates as too intense, brimming with dried red cherry, Indian spice and kalamata olive, bound by energetic acidity and tactile grip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of underbrush, black fruit, toast and espresso lead the nose on the blend of Sangiovese and 15% Malvasia Nera. The palate is still resting heavily on its oak, showing coffee, coconut, vanilla and mocha, along with dried black cherry, prune and clove. The raspy tannins need to soften up but the fruit richness is already drying up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a serious, wood-aged wine whose ripe fruits are dominated at the moment by heavy toast flavors. The fruit does offer weight and good potential, making it a structured, dark wine that is beginning to suggest a juicy future. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a herbal, earthy wine with as many tannins as fruit at this stage. That gives it a dense, dusty texture that seeps into the ripe, sweet plum flavors. With the wood giving an extra push of richness as well as spice, it needs to age. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "To judge by the weight of the bottle, this is regarded as an important wine by the producer. The wine inside is attractive and fruity, ripe with berry fruits and considerable freshness. The tannins give the power for the bottle, dry and dense at this young stage. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made to celebrate their 30th vintage, the Cazottes have produced a ripe, full-bodied wine that is still smooth and rich. Raspberries and fresh acidity give fruitiness with a delicious juicy aftertaste. Drink this wine soon, from early 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deep blueberry, prune and dried purple aromas are made even more delicious by hints of bacon fat on this blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 30% Syrah, 9% Mourvèdre and 1% Grenache. The vintner lives in the historic Uvas Valley between Gilroy and Morgan Hill. Purple fruit juiciness is balanced by a sharp licorice edge, framed by judicious acidity and tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Briny aromas of bell pepper, jalapeño and canned pea are green-leaning but not overly vegetal. This has a round mouthfeel and ample body to absorb the wine's acidity, while flavors of celery, bell pepper, lime and tangerine come with a strong grassy accent and a persistent, briny tasting finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier (CSV). From estate vineyards in the Cahors region, it is a young wine, still developing its potentially aromatic character, fragrant acidity and rich pineapple and red apple flavors. Hold this wine and drink from late 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A mix of tropical and citrus aromas is balanced by classic Leyda scents of bell pepper and jalapeño. This is crystal clear and zesty on the tongue, with cutting acidity. Lemon, tangerine and briny notes create a citrusy flavor profile, while the finish is juicy, crisp and cleansing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Minerally on the start, this white progresses into oaky vanilla and brioche notes with a heightened viscosity midway through, before re-finding its vibrancy at the end. In between expect a full-bodied, fruity expression of the variety highlighted by plenty of ripe apple and apricot.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rosy cherry and plum aromas turn more rubbery and raisiny as this airs out. Solid, lifted and deep on the palate, this varietal Garnacha deals lightly herbal, floral flavors of plum and cherry cough drop, while the finish is oaky, resiny, raw, scouring and tough. Nothing about this is subtle or elegant, but it is dynamic. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This medium-bodied wine is fresh and fruity, but also polished and sophisticated. It smells like raspberries and black plums, then adds chocolate and blackberry in the flavors. Rich and flavorful it also has welcome firm tannins and fruit acidity to keep it lively. Grenache is the leading grape ingredient.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wildflower and lemon zest brighten this dry, citrusy Pinot Gris. Lip smacking white grapefruit flavors flood the palate, along with a hint of bitter almond. It's a revitalizing white that's ready to drink, but also likely to maintain its fresh, primary flavors through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend is mostly Syrah, with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon backing it up. Dense, earthy, meaty and lightly roasted on the nose, the palate is mildly tannic, with lively acidity. Roasted, foresty plum and red-berry flavors end short and baked in character.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Vibrant and elegant, this delivers aromas and flavors of crushed red cherry, raspberry, cinnamon-spice and Alpine herbs. Supple tannins and bright acidity provide support. Enjoy through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Quite foamy when poured, this bubbly from the historic sparkling house offers aromas of apple flesh, ripe pears and lemon-lime soda. It presents straightforward flavors on the palate accented with apple blossoms, while white tuberose florals and a touch of guava trend toward the tropical side of the scale.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit, spice, underbrush and dried herbs emerge from this blend of Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. The palate delivers dried black cherries, plum, clove and grilled sage alongside tightly-knit tannins. Drink 2016–2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spicy and still tight, this shows a big-boned style. Penetrating pear fruit flavors are dotted with white pepper, and finished with a hint of water cracker.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dense aromas of earth, berry fruits, latex and animal fur are a touch challenging at first but balance out with airing. This has a crisp, fresh feel despite coming from a hot year. Lightly herbal, leathery flavors of red currant and wild berry finish oaky, with more than adequate filling.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Subdued aromas of espresso, tobacco, cedar, tilled soil and mature black fruit waft out of the glass. Made entirely with Cabernet Sauvignon, the elegant palate offers raw red currants, dried black cherries, clove and anise alongside silky but rather fleeting tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Old vines of Tinta Francisca have produced a generous, full and concentrated wine. It is packed with forward berry fruits and as well as soft tannins that are finely integrated. The end is fresh, and always fruity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from Sangiovese blended with 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with aromas of sawdust, oak, exotic spice and a whiff of black currant. The palate displays toasted oak, roasted coffee beans, menthol, ground black pepper and dried black cherries alongside grippy tannins that leave an astringent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh strawberry fruit with a bit of spice makes this an easy choice for warm-weather sipping. Tart, with lemony acidity, it's young and lively. Good as it is on its own, it would make an awesome punch.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Offered in a half-bottle size, this estate Cab-based wine also contains 6% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot. The blend is crisp, dry and tannic in cranberry, barely ripe cherry and dried currant, swerving savory into dried herb and clove.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dense and concentrated, this blend of 66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Cabernet Franc and 8% Petit Verdot initially has a subdued nose that eventually reveals prune, alcohol, tobacco and leather aromas. The syrupy palate doles out blackberry extract, fig, sweet spice and soaring alcohol alongside velvety tannins. While some may like the sheer power, the dominant alcohol stunts any complexity, giving it a monolithic quality.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Firm and spicy, this blend of Sangiovese and 10% Merlot opens with aromas of black plum, crushed violet and kitchen spices. The juicy palate delivers ripe black cherry, licorice and clove alongside a backbone of tightly wound but refined tannins. Drink 2016–2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The vineyard is in the Eola-Amity Hills AVA, though the label does not indicate it. There is a welcome purity to the fruit expression, pretty cherry flavors with a suggestion of hard candy. Although it has light herb and stem highlights, nothing overshadows the lovely fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca, this dark-colored, serious wine is concentrated and structured. It offers black fruits, giving a brooding character that's full of power. The aftertaste with its acidity and juicy fruit is elevated and leaves with a lift.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aside from hints of dark wild raspberries, this entry-level, second-label wine by Norm Yost doesn't offer overt fruit on the nose, instead showing graphite, dark earth and crushed rocks. Earthy flavors of beet juice and juniper show a slightly sour side, making for an interesting wine, if not completely delicious\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This exotic white blend starts with citrus and floral aromas and offers a palate of soft lemon curd, orange and white fruit. Rich but with a cutting finish, it's a good food wine for bigger seafood flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mature berry, underbrush, leather, fennel and a whiff of grilled herb meld together in the glass. The firm, vibrant palate shows ripe wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice, coffee and a balsamic note while bracing, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. Give this a few years to come together. Drink after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smooth and appealing, with a smoky edge to the purple plum and berry fruits, this is a flavorful, forward and easy-drinking rendition of what may become Southern Oregon's signature grape. The tannins are silky and the length impressive.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From grapes grown in the Douro Superior region, this is an open delicious fruity and ripe wine that is ready to drink. Its black currant and red berry tastes are balanced by spice, wood aged flavors and a core of tannins. The aftertaste introduces fresh juicy acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe fruit flavors and a delicious spiciness combine to make this full-bodied but not very tannic wine easy to love. It smells like cherries and raspberries, tastes full but not sweet, and has a texture that spreads and softens on the palate like melting chocolate. It's made with 50% Zinfandel and almost equal parts Syrah, Carignane and Petite Sirah.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Resiny oak and mildly stalky berry aromas muscle out cherry and raspberry scents. This feels grabby and clampy, while oaky flavors of mixed berries and baked plum end with coconut-infused oak flavors and notes of raisin and licorice. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, blue flower and Oriental spice float out of the glass. The round, full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry jam, licorice and pipe tobacco alongside chewy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is dark red-violet color to the eye, offering aromas of blackberry, roasted red pepper and juniper berry. It is very smooth on the palate, with flavors of black plum, blackberry, white peach, elderberry and violet. There is a slightly dominant eucalyptus flavor that backs off at the finish, replaced by a fresh cherry juice flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wild strawberry and a thicket of dense tannin belie a powerfully strong and elusive wine, still very much tightly wound, indicative of the vintage. A portion (35%) of the grapes were whole-cluster pressed, from tight-spaced, low-yielding vines. A little more oak was used than in most of the producer's other wines, helping to impart a spicy finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh apple and pear flavors are swathed in fresh herbs and citrus peels in this bristling medium-sweet wine. It's lusciously honeyed but finishes long with honed steely precision.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raisin and white pepper aromas, ripe fruit, floral and spicy anise flavors and full body add up to a big wine in which the whole-cluster fermentation method can be tasted. The hearty flavors, complexity and firm tannins paint a unique picture, and this bottling makes a dramatic contrast in style from the “regular” Anderson Valley Pinot Noir.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark garnet in the glass, this wine has a nose of strawberry, black plum, caramel and smoked meat. It offers a good balance of acidity and tannins, with flavors of blackberry, blueberry, smoked meat, vanilla and mocha. The vanilla flavor is extended on the palate thanks to lingering silky tannins that eventually dissolve in a note of orange zest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blue flower, mature plum, licorice, clove, mocha and menthol aromas all come together on this brawny red. The warm, bold palate delivers juicy black cherry, espresso, ground pepper and anisette alongside a backbone of fine-grained tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, it won't need years to come around. Drink 2018–2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This concentrated wine was wood aged for six months, giving the lightest touch of oak along with ripe yellow fruits and a crisp tangy aftertaste. It has a touch of spice along with bright acidity at the end. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of three estate-farmed vineyards, this is a velvety-smooth expression of the variety. It conveys a touch more richness and concentration than some of the producer's other wines, at least at the beginning of the glass, when almond and hazelnut rule the day. But then it takes on a lightness toward the lengthy finish, ending in a mix of lemon zest and apple.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine features a bouquet of cherry, pomegranate and freshly ground black pepper. It is well-balanced on the palate with flavors of pomegranate, strawberry, mace and anise. Smooth tannins are present into the bright yet lasting finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose on this appellation blend is full of soft tones of ripe nectarine and pluot, though cut with walnut oil and a citrus edge. It's more pithy in flavor, showing orange bitters, dried apples and more nut oils, slightly oxidative in style.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Planted in 1988, this vineyard 's fruit captures the unique minerality found in this AVA. It leaves an impression of sucking on rock—not a bad thing in a wine. The black-cherry fruit grips the palate with real power and some density, with potent herbal highlights as well. Drink this now through the mid-2020s.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark black cherry in color, this wine offers a bouquet of cherry preserves, matchstick and petrol. It is far livelier on the palate than on the nose, featuring flavors of cherry, pomegranate and bell pepper with a light touch of florality. Chewy tannins make their way across the gum and tongues and are all but erased by a final note of orange zest and cranberry.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark berry, mocha, toast and cooking spice aromas emerge in the glass. The taut palate offers mature black cherry, coffee and dried herb alongside assertive, fine-grained tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cherry-berry and vanilla surround a soft, spicy core of high-toned red fruit. Mellowed with age, the tannins linger in perceived sweetness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Red rose, bright berry and anisette aromas lead the way. The taut palate offers sour cherry, tobacco, clove and chopped herb alongside bracing tannins and brisk acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This brawny, forward wine opens with aromas that recall spirits, steeped plum, roasted coffee bean and menthol. The dense, chewy palate offers black cherry liqueur, licorice, espresso and the warmth of evident alcohol accompanied by brooding tannins. Drink sooner rather than later.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of rose, red berry, espresso, grilled herb and toast lead the nose. The taut palate offers crunchy red cherry, raspberry, star anise and white pepper alongside tightly wound, assertive tannins. It closes on a note of roasted coffee bean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy aromas of leather, game, sunbaked earth and mature dark-skinned berry take center stage. The tense palate offers dried black cherry, mocha, espresso licorice and tobacco alongside fresh acidity and close-grained tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mature dark berry, crushed blue flower, spice and peppermint aromas lead the nose on this structured red. The firm palate offers ripe black cherry, white pepper, cocoa, star anise and a balsamic note accompanied by bracing tannins. Drink 2018–2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cherry and plum aromas are accented by buttery oak, leather and animal notes. Solid in feel with firm tannins, this warm-vintage Tempranillo is ripe, loamy and loaded with berry and cassis flavors. A lightly raisiny finish is friendly and round. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of wild berry, dark spice, menthol and a hint of pressed flower lead the way on this straightforward Barolo. The full-bodied palate offers dark cherry, licorice and dried herb alongside firm, ripe tannins. Drink 2018–2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is strongly marked by new oak on the nose at this stage, suggesting toast, brown sugar and coffee, but fruit comes through on the palate where hints of dark berries, cola, clove and cinnamon mingle. The wine is creamy and lush in texture, with ample weight and a lingering finish of dried fruit, vanilla and mocha. Drink from 2018 to 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "One of the most beautiful package designs in the state introduces a fresh and toasty wine that translates this cool, wet vintage into a most delicate and enjoyable bottle of Pinot. Light cranberry and cherry fruit is set in a gently proportional bed of tart acid and pretty oak, 40% new.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Clean, crisp and bright, this was fermented in stainless (with just 10% in neutral wood), and not put through malolactic. The blend is 60/40 Chardonnay/Pinot Noir, yielding fresh fruit flavors of apple and melon that are focused and precise. A streak of ginger runs through racy acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of mature yellow apple and a whiff of chamomile flower lead the nose. The aromas carry over to the extremely ripe palate along with a hint of acacia and a marked note of bitter almond.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoky, toasted oak aromas lead to strong char and butter flavors and a viscous texture that clings to the palate. Subtlety is not one of this wine's virtues, as its outsized flavors stand in stark relief.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A clean nose of citrus paves the way for flavors of grapefruit and Sevilla orange. This wine is soft and pleasing on the palate, but it may be touch tart for some tastes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With its typical prickle on the tongue, this is a medium sweet wine. It's clean, crisp and citrusy, with sliced apple and orange zest flavors. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lightly spritzy, this tastes of crisp apple and finishes just off-dry. It's deliciously refreshing, bright and tangy. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a dry sparkling wine with tannins, spice and berry fruit, giving it a deep color. Not an apéritif wine, it's perfect for cutting through rich, oily foods. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a soft, creamy wine with fruitiness and a yeasty edge. Made from Bical, Arinto and Maria Gomes, it's ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a soft wine whose herbal character is held in check by a smooth texture. It is bright and crisp, with plenty of citrus and gooseberry flavors as well as intense acidity. The wine is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This white wine is fruity and crisp with a deliciously refreshing herbal edge. Lemon and pink grapefruit are cut by some zingy acidity and finished with a bright aftertaste. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dusty plum and berry aromas are clean. In the mouth, this is hard and wiry. Salty snappy plum flavors dry out and taste a bit like tin on a raw finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This yeasty wine is bone-dry, mature and ready to drink, a toasty element having replaced any fruitiness. The aftertaste is crisp and bright.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Buttery aromas and buttery, spicy flavors lend an outgoing personality to this medium-bodied wine. Vanilla and cream flavors add some interest, while the texture is broad and smooth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A soft mouthfeel and fresh golden delicious apple flavors make this light-bodied wine easy on the palate. It has crisp and clean flavors all the way through.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With hints of minerality typical of any wine from the Dão, this has tight, yeasty notes that contrast with its crisp, bright apple fruit. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine balances swathes of ripe berry fruit with hints of tannin. It's fruity, full bodied and delicious to drink now. A great barbecue wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a classic style of Bairrada sparkling wine—a blend of Bical, Maria Gomes and Arinto. Plenty of crisp acidity and soft white fruit flavors balance its yeasty character. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Surprisingly shy and reserved in nature, this offers subtle aromas and flavors of apple core and spiced orange peel. Soft and accessible, it's direct and clean, yet short on the finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A mix of blueberry, plum and animal aromas leads to a wiry, clipped palate fueled by tartaric acid. Lightly salted plum flavors are slightly jammy, while a blueberry note is brought back on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This dense, rich and ripe varietal Cabernet Sauvignon is aged in new French oak for 19 months. It shows smoked meat and bacon flavors that last into the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soft hints of peach, verbena and peony grace the delicate nose of this lightweight white. Touches of green banana and pear flesh out the palate, while ample acidity keeps the mouthfeel fresh through the finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine's blend symbolizes the Tarn's halfway position between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. So it is has the perfumed Syrah and the more structured local Braucol to give a bright fruity wine with some touches of tannin as well as red-berry fruits. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A dry wine with a soft texture that suggests a small amount of residual sugar. It is a fruity wine with apricot and ripe pear flavors and a smooth aftertaste that still leaves plenty of room for acidity. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Produced in the west of Gascony, with a strong oceanic influence, this Chardonnay is cool, fruity and with bright acidity. It does have a creamy texture that fills out the fruitiness. It is an attractive, ripe wine that is ready to drink.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pretty floral and apricot aromas brighten savory apple notes on this dry, but intensely honeyed Riesling. Bright and brisk on the palate, with searing lime acidity, it finishes long, with a refreshing spray of green herbs.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Mark VI (similar to the above Heather's Vineyard) is a sort of reserve reserve, this one from barrels chosen to showcase the most cellar-worthy aspects of the vintage. It succeeds nicely, delivering a solid, firm, tart wine with young raspberry and cherry fruit at its center. The tannins have a lightly herbal, leafy streak, and there's little doubt this will benefit from additional years in the cellar.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This intriguing blend combines the structure of Chardonnay with the crushed tomato vine and cantaloupe aromatics of Sauvignon. The rich palate delivers a lovely depth of ripe apple, creamy lemon, and melon flavors, layered with hints of exotic fruit and spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This solidly structured wine shows the firm tannins and mineral structure typical of wines from Côte du Py. It has dense black cherry fruits along with sacidity that cuts through the structure. It could age another year, but is worth drinking now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This rich wine has a dense core of dark, dry tannins. The fruit, still taking its time to come through, is full of dark plum flavors and will soon show a fresher acidity. Wood aging, dark chocolate and a smoky character all bode well for the future. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "A rich wine that is made by the Abreu Callado charity foundation. It has dark black currant fruits, big tannins and an elegant feel. With its structure, minerality and ripe, juicy fruitiness, it is finely structured and ageworthy. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "You can criticize this as being too full-bodied for a Pinot Noir. Some will find it Grenache-like, with its lush, jammy flavors of cherries, raspberries and oak. But what can't be denied is how delicious it is. The fruitiness, acidity and tannins suggest pairing with charbroiled lamb chops or steak. Drink now–2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Palmeri has a good history with Syrah, and this 2011 is right up there. With rich, complex blackberry and blueberry jam, cassis, salted grilled beef, black pepper and smoky oak flavors, it is sophisticated enough to drink with upscale fare. It should age well through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A powerfully tannic wine, full of the mineral texture and dark structure of a fine Douro wine. It has rich berry and plum skin flavors with underlining from acidity. The tannins, still young, promise aging. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Already impressive, this wine is rich and packed with tannins and fruit. The structure gives a dry core that is cushioned by the sweet blackberry fruit flavors. The end shows the tannins again, along with fresh acidity, both suggesting aging. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dried herbs accent notes of lemon and apple on this concentrated off-dry Riesling. The palate builds in intensity, with juicy flavors of peach and tangerine glazed with streaks of honey and wax. The finish is long, with bristling lemon-lime acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With a significant proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, this is a solid, tannic wine. It is also rich, complex and fruity. Fermentation in open lagares gives extra fruitiness, soft extract and great acidity. Drink from 2017.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "A very ripe wine with a velvet texture, cut with acidity and wood aging flavors. There is fine concentration, with delicious, juicy Merlot giving a ripe feel. It presents a fresh aftertaste, with the black currant fruit giving a lift to the more tannic structure. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A perfumed wine, it has structured black fruits and a solid texture. It is rich, showing complexity through its tannins along with acidity and fruitiness. Still surprisingly young to taste, it should not be drunk until 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Whiffs of blackberry, bramble and granite seduce throughout this concentrated, brawny Lemberger. The palate is lush, with ripe plum and black cherry flavors anchored by brooding minerality and a bite of firm tannins on the finish. It's lovely now, but should reveal more complexity with 5–7 years in the cellar.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark berry, shoe polish and lemony oak are at the center of the bouquet on this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petit Verdot. The palate feels rich to the point of syrupy, while the flavor profile offers a condensed, jammy mix of wild berries, wood, herbs, chocolate and coffee. Additional herbal notes along with spicy flavors carry a thick finish to its conclusion. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Black-plum and apple-skin aromas are fruity and a bit raw. In the mouth, this blend of Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Carmenère and Petit Verdot is full, properly tannic and loamy in feel. Dark-leaning flavors of licorice, peppery spice, chocolate and herbs finish with classic Chilean notes of black olive and tobacco. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a lovely, balanced wine, combining grip, texture and elegant details. It starts with clean fruit flavors of berry and cherry, bringing in delicate notes of root beer, vanilla and clove. There's a suggestion of brine also, the whole delivering marvelous complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An intriguing, well-made wine, it conveys saucy red-fruit aromas that come with notes of raw oak, leather and herbs. It smacks the palate with hard tannins and raw verve, while flavors of vanilla, mocha, licorice and berry fruits finish crisp and woody. Drink through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This delicious blend of Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot opens with aromas of ripe black fruit, berries, tilled soil, blue flower and spice. The concentrated palate delivers fleshy black cherry, red currants, black pepper and graphite alongside smooth tannins. The long finish closes on a licorice note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made by a Spanish bodega with grapes from the Portuguese Douro, this is a sophisticated Douro wine that has a smooth, ripe texture underpinned with dry tannins. Now mature, it's very elegant. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Right out of the bottle, this wine is tannic and closed. After a while in the glass, it starts to soften, showing mushroom, cola, pomegranate and raspberry flavors, but it's still resistant. Give it until 2018, and it should gradually unfold for another few years afterward.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This sophisticated wine is full of rich, beautifully integrated tropical and citrus fruits enhanced by an elegant use of wood. It feels rich, sumptuous and concentrated, while allowing for good acidity at the end. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A big, ripe wine, it shows richness from the superripe grapes. It is bold, full-bodied and packed with juicy black fruits. It's like a fruit bomb, but structure holds it together. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "At this stage, this wine is dominated by wood. The black fruits underneath will take their time to bring together a wine that will show great perfumes, flavors of mushroom and truffles, and a dense texture. The aftertaste already has some of the right juicy acidity. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is just starting out. With its initially austere structure and firm tannins, the juicy fruitiness and mineral character are still waiting to emerge. It will be a serious and structured wine in the next few years, evoking the granite of the Douro. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "You can call this Pinot thin, or you can call it elusive. While it does show the lean profile of the 2011 vintage, it's quite complex, offering high acid-inspired flavors of raspberry sour candy, chamomile tea and cranberries, plus minerally, dried herb complexities. Drinking through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Closed cellar aromas burn off to reveal black fruit, baking spices and balsamic notes. The palate is subdued, showing raw cherry-berry, cooking spices and herbs alongside nervous acidity and astringent tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This earthy Barolo has funky sensations of game, meat juices, oak, vanilla, spice and ripe black berry fruit. The warm midpalate and sweet fruit are balanced by tightly packed, astringent tannins that leave the mouth feeling dry. Drink after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pale in color, it has pleasing aromas that mix fruit and barrel with notes of cinnamon, cherry and sarsaparilla. The palate is medium bodied with the oak (30% new French and American) getting just a bit out front of the fruit flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Complex and grippy, it offers classic layers of spicy black pepper, clove and red cherry and plum fruit. Not overpowering on the palate or in price, it will pair with flair.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offers fresh fruit flavors of watermelon and strawberry. Delicate and flavorful, it's perfect for sipping on your porch, deck, boat or simply while picnicking.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe and fragrant, this offers delineated scents of cherry pie filling, raspberry, rose and dillweed. It's lithe and succulent, with polished lines and plenty of charm.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Medium to full in weight, it offers sleek acids and highly buffed tannins. Subdued notes of charred herb, dark cherry and tobacco give character to this blend of 42% Cabernet Franc, 30% Merlot, 28% Petit Verdot.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is lightly perfumed with green melon, lychee and papaya aromas. The palate is middle of the road in terms of acidity and snap. Flavors of lychee, peach and nectarine are typical of the variety, while the finish is plump and smooth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark and viscous, this blends 65% Cabernet Sauvignon with 26% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot. All settle into a high percentage of new French oak, which lends the wine a brawny, savory leather mouthfeel. The flavors tend toward olive, black pepper and cedar, a powerhouse in all.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smooth, earthy, lightly herbal aromas are balanced by fresh red-berry notes. This feels racy and lean in the mouth, with nothing fat or grabby getting in the way of steady raspberry, plum and herbal flavors. A note of olive and leafy green rises up on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wines has concentration, while also having rich, smooth fruits that exude blackberries, fresh acidity and just the right amount of wood to give complexity.  It's firm, but ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This dark cherry-red wine has aromas of red plums and dried black plums that flow to the palate. An easy drinking wine, with pleasantly tart cherry flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This grape variety originated in Spain and is also popular in the southern Rhône Valley of France. In this bottling, smoky, chocolaty aromas lead to blackberry and dark cherry flavors, a broad, generous texture and moderate tannins. It's rather big in structure but not heavy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It opens with aromas of forest floor, porcini mushroom and espresso. The straightforward palate offers bright berry, coffee and grilled herbs alongside firm tannins. Drink 2015–2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Quara makes good, true Cafayate Torrontés. Aromas of lychee, citrus, tropical fruits and bath oils are vital. This remains solid and clean, with upright acidity. Lime, mango, lychee and banana flavors finish round, with just enough acidity to maintain the wine's character. Drink immediately.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While 2010 was a great vintage in most of Spain, parts of Bierzo had a mildew problem and thus some wines are less than fully ripe. This seems to be a case in point; it's scratchy on the nose, with a sinewy, drawing mouthfeel that's only partly covered up by oak. Prickly berry and black cherry flavors finish tight, with scraping tannins. Drink now with meat or cheese.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hints of lemon curd and struck flint emerge from they lass, while the palate reveals flavors of apple, pear and citrus. With its pared-back flavors and restrained nature, this medium-bodied Chardonnay should prove versatile at the table. Drink now–2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The scents of humus, spiced blackberry and char are deep, delineated and balanced. Fine-grained tannins and lifting acids unfurl across the poised palate, and the long finish concludes with black raspberry and vanilla notes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Croatian white has delightful aromas of pineapple, tropical fruits and fresh cut honeycomb. It's round and generous in the mouth, with flavors of guava and lime rind that lead in to the clean, astringent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The somewhat light red-purple color does not mean that this medium-bodied wine lacks flavor. Toasty, smoky, caramel aromas from oak carry over to the bold and almost sweet flavors, powering over moderate raspberry and plum undertones.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This rich wine offers spice and black plum fruit flavors in equal measure. It's certainly ripe, but a fresher character adds lift. Tannins are already well-integrated into this velvet-textured wine. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of cherry, raspberry and a whiff of mint lead to flavors of dried cherry, raspberry and strawberry in this easy quaffing Pinot Noir.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A complex nose emerges as this wine opens up with chalk, soda, lemon and lime pith. The scents go well with the ocean breezes at Deep Sea's tasting room on Santa Barbara's wharf. It's lean on the palate, with lime throughout and a bit of papaya on the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The ripe and fruity style typical of Vacheron wines is evident here. Citrus flavors are given a rich fillip by yellow fruits and a rounded, full texture. Touches of minerality and youthful acidity are already well integrated into the body of the wine. Drink in 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Inviting in tropical aromas of guava and pineapple, it smells sweet but drinks dry, balanced in melon and high-toned citrus, just a hint of grass on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a fresh, lemony wine, crisp and steely. A richer element rounds out the tight texture and acidity. Lively and fruity, it will be ready to drink in 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sweet vanilla, oak, espresso, coconut and plum aromas lead the nose and carry over to the palate. The sugary vanilla and toasted oak flavors mask the Nebbiolo purity, while bracing tannins leave the mouth feeling dried out.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It offers an imprint of spearmint, dill and black cherry fruit, a modicum of tannins and a soft side, the aroma replete in rose petals. On the finish expect a darker influence of tobacco and oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of ripe plum, rose petals, cake spices and toasted oak lead the nose on this structured wine. The rich palate opens with a burst of dark cherry fruit followed by accents of roasted coffee bean, espresso, and vanilla. The succulent midpalate is cut short by astringent wood tannins that leave the mouth feeling dried out.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Winemaker Jeff Fink is unleashing a cross-section of clones in 2012, and this take on Pommard offers delicious aromas of berry-laced crème brûlée with bay leaf. There is a bitterness at first on the tannic palate, and it washes out quickly with tart cranberries.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very rich aromas of cherry, blueberry syrup and hot blackberry jam-filled pastry greet the nose. So the sour cherry and tart cranberry flavors are surprising on this medium-bodied wine, which also picks up interesting peppery notes into a lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose on this wine by oil worker-turned-winemaker Ert Sevtap offers lifting aromas of blueberry and mint. The spearmint notes carry to the palate as well, which also shows blackberry fruit and roasted beef meatiness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A touch of caramelized sugar lingers from nose to finish on this brisk wine, melding into layers of white peach, caramel and cream. It's light in body, but the mouthfeel is surprisingly round and rich. The finish is zesty and bright.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With all of the fruit hailing from Zephyr Ridge Vineyard, this wine is lighter in color, with suggestions of ash, cigar box, vanilla, coffee and red fruit. It's soft in feel, flavorful yet still quite deft. Good acidity backs it all up, finishing warm.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromatically intriguing, this carries suggestions of sour cherry, umami and fresh tobacco. The palate brings medium-bodied cranberry and cherry flavors. It doesn't have the tannic structure that this variety is known for but there is still plenty to enjoy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Prominent streaks of spice, toast and smoke persist amidst tart black cherry and cassis flavors in this full-bodied wine. Pomegranate acidity is bracing on the midpalate, accentuating a slightly brusque finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Briary plum and cherry cough-drop aromas give way to a crisp, fairly full palate with chewy tannins. Plum and peppery spice flavors are kept simple, while this finishes with some dark-berry character and a touch of bitterness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe Cabernet gives this wine a great start in life. Juicy black currant is underpinned by the wood aging and tannins, giving a wine that is fruity while still structured. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While the wine has plenty of the tannins typical of 2011 at this stage, it also has ripe fruit, full of blackberry and currant flavors. The balance is already there, giving a potentially rich, juicy and generous wine. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Swathes of fresh tarragon lend a green, herbal tone to cassis and black plum flavors in this pretty wine. Penetrating, grippy tannins are jolting on the finish, underlining a tight, brisk finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Powerful and structured, this has dense tannins that will always be an important part of the wine. The juicy, fresh fruit gives a perfumed character to the wine and brings out acidity as well as the dry texture. It needs to age, so drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This firm and dry wine is also full of acidity. A juicy start is then given a firm jolt by the tannins, but the complex structure allows plenty of room for the bright fruits. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh and juicy, this full-bodied while structured wine comes from the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers region, which gives the fruitiness and blackberry fruit flavors. It will develop quickly and can be drunk from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This moderately aromatic wine conveys Red Hots, baking spices and red fruit. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied, soft yet full of drawn-out blue-fruit flavors on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With aromas and flavors reminiscent of apple skin, peach skin, white pepper and pomegranate seed, this tastes crisp, tangy, slightly bitter, and has great bright acidity. It is light to medium bodied and made from 100% whole-cluster-pressed Riesling that was fermented in a combination of older oak barrels and stainless steel vessels.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Toffee, cinnamon apples and a hefty swirl of smoke arise on the nose from the winery's entry-level bottling. The palate shows caramelized pears, nicely bitter lemon rinds and warm, buttered nut toffee note that carries from first sip to the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 60% Vermentino and 40% Viognier, this presents a delicate fragrance of honeysuckle and stone fruit. The bright palate offers creamy white peach and tangerine, with a candied ginger note on the close.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "An unidentified mix of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot sourced from throughout the county, this is a smoky, leathery expression of sanguine black and red fruit that's approachable and easygoing. The finish has a bittersweet note of chicory.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Subdued is a good way to describe this light-bodied white made from Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc and Gewürztraminer. It has subtle aromas of honey and flowers, fresh but quiet peach flavors and a soft texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While spry and dry in style, fragrant apricot and orange blossom notes lend flair to this light-bodied wine. Tangerine acidity is bright and concentrated on the palate, leading to a swift, pert finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Coming from the cool 2011 vintage this wine offers a blue-fruit profile seldom seen in the state for this variety along with notes of chocolate and coffee. It's elegantly styled with a soft feel, trailing toward the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This concentrated, structured wine has an earthy quality, typical of some Listracs, along with a more juicy, fruity character that's boosted by acidity. Balanced, it will age over the medium-term. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh apple aromas and lively citrus flavors make a good combination in this light-bodied, tangy-textured wine. It tastes slightly rounded with sweetness, but comes off clean, crisp and appetizing. The two main components are Sémillon and Chardonnay, with dashes of Sauvignon Blanc and Orange Muscat.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is predominantly Merlot (83%) along with Cabernet Sauvignon (9%) and Syrah (2%) all from Anna Marie Vineyard, with Cabernet Franc from Minnick Hills and Petit Verdot from StoneTree Vineyard. Pleasing aromas suggest blueberry, milk chocolate and high-toned herbs. It's elegantly styled with light blue-fruit flavors, at times seeming a bit faint.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offers an intriguing mix of ripe Golden Delicious apples and a strong alkalinity characterized by crushed chalk. The palate holds tight to a lime-pith line, proving racy and lean, with just a drizzle of honey. It would be great with shellfish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sanguine in cassis, cranberry and wild strawberry, this relatively inexpensive Napa Cab has an herbal edge that suggests elegance and balance. The finish is stamped in oak that lingers on the palate without overwhelming.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The alcohol—19% as labeled—shows prominently on the aromas of this 88% Touriga Nacional and 12% Sauzao single-vineyard wine from Lonesome Springs Ranch Vineyard. Sweet chocolate and dark fruit flavors offer plenty of appeal.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Medium in weight, this offers a richness of plum and medium acidity surrounded by sizable tannin and oak. Cherry, dark currant and leather round out the characteristics, the wine aged in both French and American oak. The price is nice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Sangiovese features aromas of blue flower, dark berry and a balsamic note. The extracted palate delivers dried black cherry, ground pepper and espresso alongside bracing tannins that leave a drying, astringent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lighter in color and 100% varietal, this wine offers high-toned notes of plum, cinnamon stick and licorice. The blue and red fruit flavors are broad in feel with a light squeeze on tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Charred, earthy black-fruit aromas are smoky and power-packed. This feels full yet balanced, with freshness and strong tannins. Ripe berry, prune and oak-spice flavors finish with a note of vanilla and length. For a Crianza from a tough vintage, this is commendable.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This light-bodied wine has aromas of grapefruit and prosciutto, flavors of melon and toasted almond, making it one of the most interesting and complex versions around. Its balance is good, its texture crisp and its finish lingering.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Widely available Rioja Crianzas don't come much better than this. An opening of raspberry and strawberry aromas backed by direct cherry, raspberry and red-plum flavors render this all about fruit and freshness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a serious and satisfying dry wine with bold flavors, great structure and a mouth-filling texture. It is very well balanced in terms of fruit character and displays moderate tannins, good acidity and no excesses. It's easy to imagine on the table with a grilled rib eye.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a richer take on the grape, with aromas of baked cherries, pie crust, allspice, nutmeg and a touch of bacon fat. The palate is quite juicy, accessible and action-packed, with roasted pork, cherry jelly, blackberry jam, star anise and baking spice flavors deep into the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fragrant and fresh, this Grillo opens with alluring scents of acacia flower, beeswax and white stone fruit. The succulent palate offers creamy white peach, juicy nectarine, almond and mineral framed in tangy acidity. A note of chopped herb closes the lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full of yellow fruits, ripe apples and soft acidity, this is a rich wine with hints of spice and also attractive, perfumed acidity. It has a tangy, zesty character that is attractive and refreshing. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With some firm structure behind the red fruits, this wine will have a good future. A dry core sustained by the acidity is waiting to burst out and give a ripe, fruity while always fresh wine. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With intense acidity, this wine has both good structure and red currant and raspberry fruits. It is bright, fresh and almost crisp in character. In the background, the tannins show the dense texture of the wine. It will need to age, so don't drink before 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the vineyard once known as Alisos comes this wine, with aromas of soft clove, red cherry and a touch of sage. A strong ginger spice reigns over the palate, which is bitingly acidic, and shows dark strawberry fruit and dark thyme herbs. This wine is still quite wound up, but that acidity will prove mouthwatering for years to come.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pretty on the nose, with floral notes to go with plum, cherry and minerally aromas. While this is tannic as nails, it's super tasty, with mocha, blackberry and coffee flavors. Hard residual tannins make for a rough exit, but there's enough ripe fruit to make this work. Drink through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Laser-edged mineral tones cut a crystalline edge through this bristling, honey-kissed Kabinett. Equal parts sweet and tart, it packs a punch of crisp tangerine and lemon refreshment.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Winemakers Mikey Giugni and Michael Brughelli are the first to admit that this is an odd style of wine, but people are digging the pét-nat style. Aromas of sour apple, grass and passion fruit arise while the palate's very tight, bubbles unleash exotic tropical fruits like green papaya and green banana.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deceptively light and tight when first opened, this wine has flavors and character more in line with Gamay than most Pinots. Tart cranberry and raspberry fruit carries into a tangy finish, with citrus, mineral and herbal highlights.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With a little airing, this wakes up to reveal dark red cherries held in a taut and firm body that nonetheless has a generous core. There is some gentle grip and frank, firm acidity. It's a very honest wine without any baroque frills—but bags of forthright appeal.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Delightfully fun and refreshing, this perlwein, or lightly sparkling white, is Germany's answer to Italian prosecco. Made from Müller-Thurgau grapes, it's gorgeously floral, but with a chalky, earthen tang. Sprightly acidity and a fresh, green touch lends vibrance to a moderately long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a tight, fruity wine with high levels of acidity. That is certainly typical of the vintage and brings out very young red currant and berry fruit flavors. Even though the tannins are light, the wine is definitely one to age, so should not be drunk before 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Quince, lemon peel and honeydew make for compatible bedfellows in this no-oak white, which is light and inviting on the palate, with more underlying herbal flourishes than it first lets on. Dry and daring, it'll pair well with all manner of fresh seafood.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a nice, full-bodied red with 3% Petit Verdot. Licorice, lavender and peppery leather gather around soft, pliable tannins and meaty blackberry fruit, finding length and breadth along the way.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tonella has 16% Merlot within, from the estate vineyard around the winery. Cedar, currant and dried herb greet the nose and palate before allowing chalky, dusty tannin to season layers of chocolate and black cherry, staying structured and bright from start to finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark gold in color, this wine was whole-cluster pressed and fermented for a lengthy six months, providing for a luxuriousness of stone fruit and melon dripping in honey and caramel. It's ripe and fleshy, with a slight voluptuousness. Aged in 50% new French oak for 17 months.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dense and textural, this immediately displays a strong minerality, in its mouthfeel and racy freshness. It further amplifies the tart, tight fruit flavors of apple and citrus, grapefruit and pineapple.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Orange blossoms, night jasmine, ripe Pink Lady apples and a touch of bubblegum pop on the nose of this bottling from a coastal canyon vineyard behind Cambria. The palate shows a fine-tuned and textural grip, offering similar floral flavors as well as a botanical streak that shows a touch of pine needle and goes deep into the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Delicate white flowers and a spin of lemon peel on the nose start this refined white. The bright fruit on the palate is tropical and exotic, but the minerality gives it lift. Fuller-bodied but poised, the wine has aging potential and a food-friendly character.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very subtle hints of ripe, red apple hover above the glass. They become more apparent and richer on the slightly spiced palate that also shows hints of pepper and saffron. There is concentration on the palate and ample definition and structure provided by clean, brisk freshness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lovely notes of Reineclaude plums play on the nose. The palate is soft but also has echoes of pebble and stone. Fluid and fresh, the wine even shows overtones of white blossom on the palate. It's a lovely, lasting and authentic expression of Alsace.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A certain faint spiciness hovers over everything, recalling honeysuckle. The textured palate is fresh and equally pepper-spiced. This has freshness and verve, a certain ease and tons of lemony crispness. If you wanted to hold a party to welcome summer, this would be the perfect wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bright and fruity Beaujolais-style wine is as light and refreshing as a young wine can possibly be. It delivers a smile-inducing burst of strawberry and cherry fruit—round, ripe and juicy. You absolutely want to drink this sometime in 2016 while all that youthful energy remains.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Winemaker Mike Mooney adds complexity with 16% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Merlot on this bottling, which shows blueberries, crushed black rocks and dark chocolate on the nose, but doesn't offer a lot of Cab Francness. The palate does offer some, however, with grippy tannins and dried oregano touches laid across rich black cherry, blueberry, fudge and espresso notes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Slovenian Ribolla Gialla has aromas of peach and vanilla, with flavors of freshly baked peach pie, canned apricots and green apple. It is soft on entry, rounded in the mouth and shows good minerality on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Underbrush, pipe tobacco, blue-flower, berry and star anise aromas unfold in the glass. The firm, elegant palate offers dried cherry, clove, mint and orange peel alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine opens with aromas of baked plum, leather, underbrush, grilled herb and a toasted note. The ripe, chewy palate offers raspberry jam, fleshy black cherry, licorice and a hint of vanilla alongside solid tannins. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Baked pears, tangerine oil and wet-cement minerality show on the nose of this rich yet balanced wine from one of the region's premiere sites. The palate shows Gala apples, honeysuckle and blood-orange rinds, blending ripeness with grippy tartness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An estate-grown wine in its second vintage, this comes from the cooler-climate hills of the coast. This plush wine is dark brown in color and brimming in stinky earth—a rich, funky and concentrated expression that's herbal, spicy and shy in raspberry fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Medium bodied and restrained on the palate, this wine offers a mix of caramelized lemon and Gravenstein apple. It ends lengthy with tastes of ginger and lemongrass that leave a refreshing finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From vineyards in both Alexander Valley and Bennett Valley, the grapes were fermented in French oak for eight months, a minority of it new. This is a medium-bodied, integrated wine rich in caramel apple and fresh-squeezed tangerine. Brisk and in balance, it finishes with a note of toasted almond.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Vanillla, baking spice and dried herb aromas are at the forefront. The dark-fruit flavors are dense, supported by lively acids and firm but well integrated tannins. It's a delicious example of the variety.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine has hints of cedar and coriander, a luxurious, velvety and appropriately tannic texture, and flavors that are ripe and delicious. Its personality seems confident, well balanced and well behaved, but strong and focused.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of charred earth, toast, ground pepper, mature black-skinned fruit and espresso lead the nose. The big, ripe palate presents licorice, fleshy black cherry, clove and tobacco alongside a tannic backbone.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Merlot and 15% Malbec has well-balanced tannins and scents of black raspberry, vanilla and caramel. Sweet vanilla, cherry pie and blueberries are the predominant tastes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 32% Alvarelhão, 31% Souzão, 24% Touriga and 13% Tinta Cão shows baked black cherries, licorice, gingerbread, iron and smashed asphalt on the nose. The palate is soft and rich, with jammy cherry, blueberry and blackberry flavors eloquently spiced by clove, framed by silky tannins and cut with a welcome acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The first of the vintage to be tasted from the region, this bottling is a promising sign. Fresh-cut green apples, Anjou pear skins, honeydew, bubblegum, wet stone and whiffs of cut grass show on the nose. There's lots of verve to the palate, with white pepper, apple skin and slight jalapeño flavors. It's perfect for shellfish and salads.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A ripe and rich wine, this is full of jammy red fruits. The structure is well integrated into the fruits, giving a smooth, ripe wine that's developing attractively. With a juicy, fresh aftertaste, it is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of menthol, toast, espresso and mature black-skinned fruit come together on this accessible, full-bodied red. The ripe, chewy palate offers cherries marinated in spirits, blackberry jam, vanilla and a confectionary note alongside velvety tannins. You'll also note the warmth of alcohol on the midpalate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intensely tropical aromas extend into the palate of this exuberantly ripe, fruity off-dry Riesling. Hibiscus-nectar sweetness intensifies luscious white peach and melon flavors, but is offset squarely by a dazzling streak of lemony acidity. It's juicy and satisfying through a long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Abundant dried and fresh herb aromas are followed by notes of black currant and blackberry. The palate brings full-feeling black-fruit flavors that provide instant appeal. It's a crowd pleaser.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark violet-red in color, this wine has a bouquet of blueberry, brambles and flint. It is soft on entry, with a web of tannins that spreads across the palate. Flavors of cherry preserves, bacon and juniper berry are at play in the mouth, and bright fruit notes and tactile tannins come in waves through the lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 71% Syrah, 16% Grenache, 8% Zinfandel, 3% Petite Sirah and 2% Mourvèdre stands up to Paso blends three times its price. Broad aromas of plum, olallieberry and dried cherry mix with vanilla, dill and herbes de Provence on the nose. The creamy palate conveys boysenberry and blackberry seasoned by lavender and white pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A soft, chewy and smoky vineyard-designate, this wine is defined by a depth and breadth of sizable tannin, black plum and chocolate, celebrating ripeness and voluptuous in a glass.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An expansive, full-bodied and generously rich wine, this features present but integrated oak. Aromas of orange blossom and jasmine rise slowly out of the glass to lighten the experience, polished in bites of green apple and pineapple.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wild cherry, rose, spice and chopped sage aromas come together on this round, savory wine. The juicy palate offers fleshy black cherry, raspberry, star anise and a coffee note set in a framework of polished tannins. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Colorino and 5% Canaiolo, this offers pretty aromas of pressed rose, violet, berry, menthol and a whiff of ground cooking spice. The linear palate offers mature black cherry, orange zest, clove, white pepper, licorice and a hint of pipe tobacco alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Black fruits, fine herbs and horsehide carry the aromas of this offering. In the mouth, this is firm and well built, with integrated tannins. Savory flavors of soy sauce and roast plum share space with bolder, riper cherry notes, while a warm, earthy finish tastes of roasted plum and berry. Drink through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mostly Sangiovese with 5% Colorino and made by refermenting with partially dried grapes, this wine offers aromas of dried plum, clove, scorched earth and a balsamic note. The concentrated palate offers dried black cherry, raisin, licorice and a note of ground pepper that lead to a firm finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is made from 92% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Pinot Noir, an interesting and fulfilling combination thats robust on the palate. Pinkish-orange in color, it's both tangy and weighty, finishing dry in orange zest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Black-olive tapenade is the star of this show, along with fig, black currant and cedar. Bittersweet cocoa accents the powerful tannin and integrated oak, before finishing velvety smooth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is a toasty aroma in this wine that comes from a premier cru next door to Chassagne-Montrachet. This toastiness continues into a spicy, toasty note. A good sense of fruitiness gives the wine a ripe and rich character that will allow it to mature well. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lusciously ripe mango and lychee aromas introduce this unusually sprightly Gewürztraminer. Perfumed and delicately sweet, but not at all cloying, it's vivacious and thirst quenching, finishing on a enticingly astringent tea-leaf note. Drink now through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the cool plains of the Petaluma Gap, this wine shines in violet and blueberry crumble aromas. Light bodied, it reveals deeper, darker pepper steak-like flavors as it opens, finishing on an elegant aftertaste of clove.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Usually the bigger, more opulent of the Kumeu River Chardonnays, the 2015 version of the Coddington is medium to full in weight, but strikingly focused and vibrant. Bacony smoke notes frame white peach flavors, finishing long.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This premium cuvée from Eugénie is packed both with superripe fruit and layers of wood aging flavors. The fruit of this impressive wine is still pushing through the dark tannins that give a dry dusty edge to the wine. It is powerful and rich and should age. Drink from 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Vines up to 50-years-old are the basis of this rich and tannic wine. While it does have some age, it still has a way to go. Big bold tannins show strongly along with ripe black-plum skins. The wood aging has given this wine a smooth elegant edge that contrasts with the still young fruitiness. Drink from 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich red cherry, rhubarb and alpine strawberry aromas meet rust and shaved licorice on the nose of this beautiful bottling from the Parker family's cool-climate vineyard. It's deceptively light on the palate, with airy flavors that intensify to exotic cherry, mulberry, tea leaf and maduro cigar, framed by firm, structured tannins. Drink 2020–2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine comes from one of the producer's oldest blocks in Carneros, where grapes retain vibrant acidity. Reduced on the nose, it opens up into a mix of fennel, preserved lemon and almond aromas that follow through on the steely palate with grace.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a new, small producer, this vibrantly peppery wine captures the power and grace the variety is capable of when grown on the far reaches of the coast. That peppery quality follows through on the palate, buoyed by juicy acidity and smoothly layered blackberry, tobacco and tea flavors. Exquisitely made and worth seeking out.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The biggest production and lowest priced of all the winery's vineyard designates, this is sexy, substantial and one of the best offerings from any winery sourcing fruit from this exceptional vineyard. A riot of berries, plums and Asian spices fills the mouth—well-integrated, layered and detailed right on through the extended finish. A light dusting of cocoa powder lingers and invites the next sip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Vinified by the former Margerum winemaker (who now works for Morgan Winery), this bottling from one of the appellation's most exciting vineyards is chock-full of baked red cherry, vanilla, clove and gravel aromas. Though light and bright in body, the palate packs intriguing flavors, from raspberry and rose petal to dried fennel and dill.\n",

      "Wonderfully aromatic fruit rises from the glass: blueberry with cinnamon and violet overtones, hints of plum and pepper and a pervasive elderberry note. This is a wonderfully elegant medium-bodied wine with a distinct but unobtrusive structure that lets the fruit speak clearly and honestly. Fresh and elegant now, it's sure to develop and evolve. Drink now–2025.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "The floral, vanilla tone of new oak marries with ripe, red cherry notes in this wine, supported by clove and violet highlights.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine offers aromas of herb, tobacco, barrel spice and plum. The palate brings plush rich textured plum flavors, showing a beautiful sense of purity along with a crazy-long finish. It's a shamelessly delicious but still impeccably balanced wine that is nearly impossible to put down.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe but subtle aromas of aged balsamic vinegar, blackberry, baked plum and vanilla are alluring and feed into a flush layered palate. Spicy black plum and berry flavors are just rustic and toasty enough, while this blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with Cab Franc and Merlot tastes peppery, deep, a touch hot and on the money. Drink from 2018–2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "Envoy is Spy Valley's top range of bottlings. In this case, it's a single-vineyard wine that's fermented and matured in oak for 11 months. It's medium-bodied and silky in texture, with distinctive fumé notes, hints of struck match, and layers of passion fruit and grapefruit flavors. Dry, austere and long on the finish, it's a compelling example of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine shows a fine balance between sweetness (74 g/L) and acidity, reminiscent of a spätlese style. Striking scents of crushed stone, beeswax and lime burst from the glass, while the flavors combine peach and citrus notes. The finish shines, marrying sugar and acid into a long, tongue-tingling finale.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 35% Chardonnay, 35% Pinot Blanc and 30% Pinot Gris from La Encantada Vineyard is a stunner, starting with its crystalline brilliance in the glass. Lime blossom, pomelo, baking soda and lanolin aromas lead into a grippy palate of green apple, chalk and wet cement. Extremely tense and compelling.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This cuvée, says winemaker Josh Bergström, is crafted to compete with village Burgundies. Principally Temperance Hill fruit, it more than does the job, with great mouthfeel, and a succulent tangy ripe mix of citrus and stone fruits. There's a lick of caramel apple coming through also, and the wine is bursting with bright flavors across the board.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Actress Challen Cates got interested in wine when her father ran Tantara Winery. She's since hired winemaker Kevin Law to deliver great bottlings like this one. It's redolent with sarsaparilla, red plum, mulberry and cola, and shows deft balance on the palate, combining plum, cherry, licorice and ginger flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of roasted earth, leather and fine oak are more out-front than berry fruit, and that's the way it should be for a Gran Reserva. This feels bold, lively and still a touch bumpy. Chocolaty oak and vanilla notes rest comfortably on top of ripe berry and black-plum flavors, while the finish is persistently earthy and chocolaty. Drink through 2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A ripe fruity set of berry and cassis aromas shows a slight hint of raisin. This is a stacked saturated wine with raw tannins and plenty of power. Blackberry and earthy notes finish stout and compact: this doesn't vary or waver on the back end. Best from 2019–2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A more intense version of Carraovejas's Reserva from 2012, this also includes more than 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Thus it's spicy and prickly on the nose, with road tar and peppery notes in addition to potent berry fruit. A rich saturated rumbling palate deals coffee, toast, blackberry and herbal flavors that are much like the Reserva but more amplified. A charred finish has a lemony ring to it. Drink from 2020 through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dominated by the local Mourvèdre grapes, this is a ripe and complex wine. Its acidity is integrated with rich yellow fruits, spice and perfume. The wine is floral, poised and very stylish. Drink from late 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Savory in aroma, richly fruity and accented with butter and vanilla, this wine has a complete package of flavors and an expert balance to accompany its creamy viscosity. It combines lightly toasty, earthy notes with generous pear and citrus flavors in a way that's unusual and compelling. Best after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Forest floor, leather, tilled soil, ripe berry and balsam are some of the aromas you'll find in this delicious red. The smooth, dense palate delivers blackberry jam, espresso, licorice and ground pepper flavors, blanketed with soft, silky tannins. Tobacco and graphite notes linger on the finish. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Juicy strawberry and red plum aromas meet cinnamon, sassafras and earthy scents in this bottling from winemaker Colin Murphy. Beautiful layers of sour cherry combine with dried fennel, wild mint, thyme and rose petal flavors on the palate, which finishes clean and crisp.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of fruit from Watermill, Funk, Lewis and Anna Marie vineyards, the aromas bring vibrant notes of flowers, ham hock, berry, tapenade, herb and ember. The palate is plush yet elegant and silky in feel, showing an exquisite mix of fruit and savory flavors along with outrageous hang time on the finish. It shows a lot of subtlety.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine's dried pear, hay and hayflower scents create an immediate impression of richness. The palate underlines all of these generous flavors with a unique, streamlined freshness that illuminates. This is what happens when good Grüner Veltliner benefits from a little bottle age: Its herbal, lifted allure comes to the fore. Savor this.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine's fresh, ripe red cherry and aromatic strawberry touches make for an inviting nose. The palate shows the same intense primary fruit, bolstered by freshness and a fine, filigreed structure. Its supple, pure fruit makes it very enjoyable now, but it's sure to evolve further with bottle age. Drink now–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the vineyard planted by the Pisoni and Franscioni families, this wine delivers bright raspberry and strawberry aromas with sweet star anise spice. The medium-bodied palate is lively and boisterous, with ripe cranberry, tangy red plum skin and sour cherry flavors, accented with a helping of dried herbs.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Firm and focused, this lightly spiced effort supports its tart cherry fruit with ample acidity. Hints of toasted coconut build in the finish. A few more years of bottle age should bring further integration.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A striking shade of amber/orange, this soft and fruity wine is open and loose knit, with broad flavors of mature, slightly oxidized tree fruits, plus lightly spicy notes of cinnamon and baking spices. It's very well made, but well apart from any standard approach.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A delicate streak of honeycomb gilds layers of yellow peaches, apples and tangerines in this off-dry Riesling. Its concentrated fruitiness is lip smacking, but it's also quite elegant, reverberating long on a steely strike of acidity and minerality. Drink now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mature black fruit, toast and spice aromas lead the nose. The firm palate is still tightly wound, offering baked black cherry, licorice and espresso balanced by youthfully assertive, taut tannins. Drink after 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crushed rose, pressed violet, perfumed berry, sage and a balsamic note are just some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied red. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, black pepper and licorice alongside tightly knit tannins and the subtle warmth of alcohol. Give it a few more years to come together. Drink 2018–2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A nose of wild blackberry and brambles lays the groundwork for a tender dance of fruit and herbal flavors, especially blackberry, pomegranate, eucalyptus and fennel bulb. Mouth-coating tannins dissipate on the finish, joined by a burst of tart pomegranate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Produced from vines grown in a boulder and fossil strewn vineyard, this is a rich smoky wine. It has a deep color from the Alicante Bouschet in the blend, with firm tannins and dark juicy plum skin flavors. It's going to be a ripe rich wine as it develops. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This lovely wine captures the floral, perfumed essence of the grape in a restrained, sippable style. It's dry and crisp, with lemony fruit and the delicate sensation that you are drinking fresh flowers.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with earthy aromas of scorched earth, ripe berry, leather and a funky whiff of game. The full-bodied palate offers mature black cherry, black raspberry, truffle, grilled sage, ground pepper and a hint of tobacco alongside youthfully assertive, solid tannins. Drink after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Root beer, cola nut, black cherry, black raspberry and anise seed combine for an exciting nose on this bottling from a winery near Morgan Hill. The mouthfeel is full, with graphite and lively fennel-bulb spice mixing with blackberry fruit and an earthy elegance on the pleasing palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Juicy succulent tangerine and yellow peach flavors meld on the palate of this forward fruity off-dry wine. On first taste, it's quite straightforward, but added attention reveals glimmers of spice, saffron and mineral complexities. Drink now through 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Situated in the center of the premier crus of Puligny, Champgains produces an elegant, textured wine. This bottling, with the warmth of 2013 behind it, is fragrant with white fruits and has a soft aftertaste. It needs to age to bring it out its more complex character, so wait until 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With its appealing toast and fruit aromas, this is a rich wine. It does keep plenty of steely texture while allowing the yellow fruits, ripe pear and toast to shine. In style it hovers halfway between the ripe, buttery Meursault of the past and the crisper style of today, a fine compromise and ready to drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A minuscule amount of this wine is made, coming from 45-year-old vines. Ripe, dense and dusty red and black berries combine against soft, approachable layers of integrated tannin and oak, finishing with leather and cigar.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of pressed rose, dried berry, leather, chopped herb, cinnamon and a balsamic note emerge in the glass. The subtle palate delivers dried black cherry, black raspberry, licorice and a hint of tobacco alongside firm, ripe tannins. Enjoy sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit richness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of mature black plum, espresso, wild rose and spice emerge on this full-bodied red. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, menthol, mint, white pepper, well-integrated oak and licorice alongside fine-grained tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pressed rose petal, red berry, chopped herb and a whiff of exotic spice come together on this elegantly structured red. The medium-bodied palate offers juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, ground pepper and anise alongside firm, polished tannins. Drink 2017–2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose is initially rather closed but eventually reveals dark berry, blue flower and brown baking spice. The ripe palate offers mature black cherry, coffee, cocoa, star anise and chopped sage alongside tightly packed tannins. Give this another two or three years to let the tannins unfurl, then enjoy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rose, red berry, baked earth, forest floor and grilled herb aromas lead the nose while the firm palate offers dried black cherry, cake spice and anise. Firm, fine-grained tannins provide the backbone. Drink 2018–2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Offering aromas of black cherry and green pepper with a whiff of matchstick, this wine has flavors of black cherry, raspberry, smoked meat, mace and green tea. There is a good yin and yang of fruit and savory flavors, while chewy tannins wane at the first sign of orange zest on the bright finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blackberry and leather pouch jump from the glass from this full-bodied wine that stays light on its feet despite the generous ripeness. Cinnamon, black pepper and black licorice round out the flavors, finishing soft and with length.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Although this wine is listed as a white blend, the producer says the variety is Vernaccia, not found often in California. Light in alcohol and approach, it opens in a bouquet of waxy apple and Meyer lemon, followed by a medium-powered palate of pear. The finish is crisp and lean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This pale-colored rosé is made from Chardonnay with the addition of Pinot Noir still wine to give the color. It is fresh and crisp, offering a lively mousse with attractive flavors of raspberry and fresh red currants. With its refreshing acidity, it is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of dark berry, tilled soil, underbrush and espresso lead the nose while the taut palate offers sour cherry, sage, white pepper and star anise. It's still tightly wound and nervous, with bracing tannins. Drink 2019–2029.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of oak extract, toast, red berry and espresso wrap around this structured wine. The firm palate offers up sour cherry, ground pepper and licorice alongside assertive, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark plum and milk chocolate are the stars of this chalky, soft wine, almost entirely varietal, with a splash of Petit Verdot. Integrated oak helps make it approachable and fruit-forward, while the finish is subtle in fireplace smoke.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In this blend, Cabernet Sauvignon was co-fermented with Petite Sirah, with 70% of the grapes grown in the Napa Valley. There's a compelling richness of earthy truffle and red berry in the wine, supported in full-bodied breadth by a grip of tannin. Bennett Valley Syrah and Dry Creek Merlot also figure into the mix.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The regular bottling from the estate vineyard takes the spotlight in 2013, with a lightness and delicacy that in no way means it is simple or insubstantial. There's much to admire, from the silky cherry fruit to the dusty traces of sandalwood, saffron and butter brickle.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "All Pinot Noir, fermented in neutral oak and put through partial malolactic, this belongs in the rosé category. A pretty, pale-copper color, it offers a pleasing toasted-cracker frame around stone fruit and supple acids. Drink this chilled to white wine temperature.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 71% Roussanne, 21% Grenache Blanc and 8% Picpoul Blanc offers cut Meyer lemon, tangerine and pink-grapefruit aromas on the nose, along with the promise of a creamy palate. Instead, the palate is quite tight and restrained, starting tart but opening toward lemon rinds and pear flesh, and wiping up clean on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Still young, the wine is very mineral, smoky and tight, with considerable structure and concentration. The apple and citrus fruits are attractive, although almost a sideshow compared with the texture of the wine. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Creamy and lush, this offers currents of tropical coconut complemented by floral gardenia and pear. Made in a fuller style than some of the winery's other vineyard-specific wines, the generosity of fruit is expertly offset by searingly pleasant acidity, sustaining it sip after sip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From winemaker Bryan Kane, who also makes the Howell Mountain Vineyards' wines, comes this tiny-production Cabernet Sauvignon from two separate Howell Mountain sources. A delight in black plum, licorice and peppery leather, it's soft and complex. Boysenberry highlights the fruit components, while the finish is deftly marked by wild vanilla.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pineapple, candied apple and a touch of guava jelly on toast achieve great aromatic balance on a rare Rancho Santa Rosa Chardonnay. The flavors are lush, not racy, and evolve in a mellow fashion, from apple to nectarine and then papaya.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a finely perfumed wine, full of ripe Castelão grapes. It has a smooth, polished feeling from the wood aging, yet still allows plenty of room for a dense black-fruit character. It will need to age and will be best after 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soft and rich, this warm, rounded wine has concentrated fruitiness along with a more tense mineral structure. Its pink grapefruit, ripe melon and zesty lemon flavors combine to give a wine that is only just setting out. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A truly aromatic Riesling that has a wonderful series of fruit and spice perfumes. It's ripe and full in the mouth, offering a strongly mineral edge as well as rich apple and citrus. Textured and still very tangy, the complex wine needs to age, so drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fronholz is from a single vineyard, a heady, perfumed wine with ripe, smooth undertones. While there is plenty of acidity, it's the opulent, ripe texture that comes right up front. A light touch of honey and melon roundness give a creamy aftertaste. Drink now, but better from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is still young, a tight wine with nervy acidity and very fresh fruitiness. A strongly mineral character from the chalk soil adds to the sense of dry, steeliness. It still needs to age, so drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This concentrated wine has weight and richness while also showing a firm, very mineral and tight texture. The green fruits, aromatic red currants and tangy zest are partnered by young and exuberant freshness. It needs a few years to show its paces, so drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aged for 14 months in oak, this is a rich, concentrated and dense yet smooth wine. Licorice and cassis combine, with some bitterness on the firm palate. Give it time for the tannins to mellow and harmonize a bit further; drink after 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich while also structured, this is beginning to be delicious. Acidity comes from the black currant fruits while the structure shows dense tannins and wood-aging flavors. The wine is still young and prepared for a long haul, so don't drink before 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the second wine of Château Labégorce. It has much of the elegance of the top wine with firm tannins and generous fruits kept in stylish proportion. Black currant and berry fruits lie under the dark, dry exterior. The wine is dense, needing several years' aging. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This single-vineyard offering opens with aromas of blue flower, tilled soil, ripe berry, balsamic notes and a hint of leather. The palate is still young and needs time to develop fully but already delivers layers of dark cherry, licorice, grilled herb and black pepper alongside brooding tannins. Drink 2016–2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lovely fragrances suggest wild berry, red flower, moist earth and sweet baking spices. The palate delivers juicy black cherry layered with notes of white pepper, cinnamon and licorice supported by a tight framework of youthfully feisty tannins that need time to tame. Drink 2016–2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from 100% Syrah and aged in half new French oak, this brawny Syrah hails from a vineyard known for its mix of power and finesse. Sanguine and smoky, the fruit leans toward blueberry and the texture to leather, a streak of graphite in the background. Tannins are firm and sizable, with a balanced finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is woody, silky, and balanced between tones of tobacco leaf and herb and a swath of dark leather. It's high-toned and elegant, showcasing the softer side of Cabernet from a cool vintage, with a lengthy, memorable finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Just under 16% alcohol, this nonetheless displays lush and pure flavors of blueberry and black cherry, dusted with cinnamon and sandalwood. The concentration is exceptional.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In the ownership of the Cálem family since the 19th century, Sagrado produces firmly structured wines. This dark and dense example is only just ready to drink. It is a powerful and juicy wine, full of opulent black fruits that are balanced by acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Cabernet-based blend offers lovely black cherry flavors and scents of violet, with a hint of licorice and substantial, ripe tannins on the palate. It can age for at least another 6–8 years, though it's drinking quite nicely already.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blueberry, dried lilac, crushed violet and black pepper form a classic nose on this Merlot-led Bordeaux blend from Paso Robles' celebrated Westside. The well-integrated, complex palate features fruit, herbs, spice and tar, as if each one plays back-to-back solos.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "As per usual, Purple Angel is a full-force experience. Hailing from a warm year, this is dense and purple in color, as it should be. Aromas of graphite, oak, tobacco and black fruit set up a jammy, full palate with saturated flavors of spice-laden blueberry and boysenberry. Finishing notes of tobacco, herb and oak cement this big-boned wine's ripe, beefy status. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This attention-grabbing debut Chardonnay comes from a new sister winery to Roederer Estate in Mendocino County. It shows a vivid yellow-gold color, butterscotch and hazelnut aromas, butter and bosc pear flavors and tasty bread dough accents. Rich and full in flavor, it's sleek in texture, but not too full-bodied.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A fine,  wood-aged wine from the Dão's star white grape, it gives yellow fruit tones of apricot and peach, with toast and lees flavors providing a rich, full-bodied structure. The acidity cuts right through the palate, bringing out a lively, fresh aftertaste. Drink now, but the wine will be better in 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon made in small amounts from multiple vineyards, including Beckstoffer Missouri Hopper in Oakville and the Somerston Vineyard on the eastern edges of the Napa Valley. Rich and concentrated in black plum and berry, this is a supple wine that's highlighted by a seasoning of dusty tannins and coconut shavings. The finish is awash in chocolate and cinnamon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With no new oak, La Sereinité is indeed serene, textured and round with vibrant acidity. The aromatics do the talking first, inviting one in with nuanced white peach, orange blossom and lime before the palate develops over time into richer, fuller flavors of crème brûlée. Throughout, the wine is balanced and expressive.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh, brambly raspberry and cherry open this wine that's structured in firm tannins and ripe, lingering layers of tobacco and clove. The Cabernet is blended with smaller amounts of Malbec and Petit Verdot. This one is enjoyable now, with a long and clean finish, but it will also cellar well through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A fine blend of the classic Douro grapes gives a complex and dark wine that's firm in tannin but also offers ample fruity richness. The wood aging has started the process of smoothing the tannins, working towards a ripe, full-bodied wine. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From one of the most celebrated vineyards in Barbaresco, this structured wine offers aromas of mature black fruit accented with whiffs of balsamic herbs and new leather. The palate delivers crushed black cherry and rasberry layered with notes of black pepper, licorice and menthol alongside assertive tannins. It needs time to unfold and develop. Drink 2016–2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This starts out smooth and rounded and then begins to develop a drier, firmer character. Putting the flattering richness and the structure together and the wine is both rich and solid, with black currant fruits vying with a dry core. It still needs time; drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This warm, ripe wine is open and ready to drink. With its bold red fruit and generous, well-integrated tannins, it's made for barbecues. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A lovely flinty character graces the yellow apple, peach and orange cream aromas on the nose of this friendly wine. It's quite round and mouthfilling, with a prevailing smoky flavor on the palate that's reminiscent of baked apple with bacon crumble. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A very pale, watery straw color, this is soft and low in intensity, with faint aromas and flavors of citrus pith and fresh grass. The palate is thin and light, followed by a short, brisk finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Like the hyperexpensive Cuvée à Tempo, Pegau's 2015 Cuvée Reservée has a slightly bitter edge to the finish. Otherwise, it shows subtle pineapple, anise and white gumdrop notes and medium body.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Eight years down the line and this Malbec shows the flaws caused by a harvest marred by freezes. This smells like a mix of green bean and jammy boysenberry. The palate feels saturated but soupy, with outsize acidity. Green-herb flavors mix with baked plum and blueberry, while the finish feels sticky, tannic and heavy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "Scents of green apple and plum lead the bouquet, with a strong lime-pith note that carries through to the palate. The texture is soft and somewhat flat on the midpalate, but ample acidity and a pleasant astringency help to lift the close. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Reduced on the nose, this wine has a nuttiness and a petrol-like quality that colors its otherwise thin dried plum flavor. Low in oak, it will pair well with traditional Italian fare.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a crisp, lightly perfumed wine with attractive apple acidity and touches of grapefruit. The texture is soft, with a bright aftertaste. Drink now.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This range of wines comes from different regions of the southwest. The white comes from Gascony and is typical local blend. It is crisp and fruity with a soft texture from the ripe Colombard. There is a light dancing character to this lively, fruity wine. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an easygoing fruity wine. It has soft tannins and bright juicy red fruits. The structure is just right to give the wine its shape along with the acidity and generous aftertaste. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is one of several wines from this producer that are created to give lie to the tannic Malbec. This is soft, ripe and full of the young fruitiness that demands to be drunk now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine starts out a bit reduced, along with aromas of melon and red apple. It drinks a hair off dry, with a blend of stone-fruit and tropical flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blended with less than a handful of Petite Sirah, this wine is thick and ultraripe, showing dense chocolate and plum sauce flavors, accented with soy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A soft and ripe wine with spicy red fruit flavors cushioned by a smooth texture, this has well-embedded tannins and can be drunk young.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soft and smooth, this is a ripe and creamy wine. It has light acidity, pineapple and apricot flavors and a rounded aftertaste. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of vanilla and wood spice lead to elegant, somewhat dried out and dilute fruit flavors, followed by a short finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pine notes and an aroma akin to floor polish make for an iffy start. This carries a slight chemical flavor as it moves along, while honey and brown-sugar notes sweeten things up. A chunky, obtuse finish feels sticky due to mild acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hints of nut and spice on the nose lift flatter tones of pressed apple and pear in the palate of this medium-bodied white. Soft lemonade acidity brightens the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dusty, generic plum and berry aromas are highly regular. This Malbec is chunky in feel, without much precision. Oaky buttery slightly greasy berry flavors finish hot and creamy, with little to no elegance or cut.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Round and pillowy in feel, this is a simple wine, offering modest melon and pineapple fruit. Drink it over the next few months.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A highly unusual blend of Burdin, a rare French hybrid, and Chambourcin grapes, this red wine offers delicate maraschino-cherry and berry flavors. It's a slightly fragile wine but whiffs of tobacco and garden soil lend complexity. The finish lingers on tart red fruit flavors and a hint of tannin.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The 12 months of wood aging has left its mark on this wine, giving it a spicy burnt character. That makes it tough and unlikely to broaden out. It will likely remain dry and firm.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made to be drunk young, this wine gives a burst of ripe red fruit. The tannins are soft and open, balanced with acidity. The aftertaste is smooth and generous. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Named for the Servite convent in the town of Borba, this fresh, crisp and tangy wine is citric, with almond and apple overtones. It's young, fruity and made for immediate consumption.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A typical Douro blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Tinta Barroca, this wine is all about bright, crisp fruit. Black and red currant flavors come with tight acidity and a juicy character. Tightly wound now, it needs a few more months to calm down. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of Chardonnay, Garganega and Sauvignon, this has aromas of peach and golden apple. The simple palate offers pineapple and banana alongside bright acidity. Enjoy soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An intriguing blend of grapes with both Bordeaux and Gaillac origins has produced a wine that has a softly herbal character as well as richer white stone fruits and an attractive perfume. It is a pretty wine, ready to drink and very fruity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "According to legend, the Baron of Figuiera got his foot stuck in the stirrup while riding one day. He promised that where his horse stopped, he would build a chapel, and that's where this 2,100 foot high, cool-climate vineyard is today. The wine is crisp and fresh, with attractive citrus notes and plenty of refreshing acidity. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A large production offering, this white is simple and direct in its expression of the variety, remaining steely and low in oak on the palate, with a depth of green apple and melon fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Swathes of fresh tarragon lend a green, herbal tone to cassis and black plum flavors in this pretty wine. Penetrating, grippy tannins are jolting on the finish, underlining a tight, brisk finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Powerful and structured, this has dense tannins that will always be an important part of the wine. The juicy, fresh fruit gives a perfumed character to the wine and brings out acidity as well as the dry texture. It needs to age, so drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This firm and dry wine is also full of acidity. A juicy start is then given a firm jolt by the tannins, but the complex structure allows plenty of room for the bright fruits. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh and juicy, this full-bodied while structured wine comes from the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers region, which gives the fruitiness and blackberry fruit flavors. It will develop quickly and can be drunk from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This moderately aromatic wine conveys Red Hots, baking spices and red fruit. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied, soft yet full of drawn-out blue-fruit flavors on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With aromas and flavors reminiscent of apple skin, peach skin, white pepper and pomegranate seed, this tastes crisp, tangy, slightly bitter, and has great bright acidity. It is light to medium bodied and made from 100% whole-cluster-pressed Riesling that was fermented in a combination of older oak barrels and stainless steel vessels.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Toffee, cinnamon apples and a hefty swirl of smoke arise on the nose from the winery's entry-level bottling. The palate shows caramelized pears, nicely bitter lemon rinds and warm, buttered nut toffee note that carries from first sip to the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blended with 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers notes of herbs, ground cranberries and woodspice. Flavors are jammy with an astringent squeeze to the tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of underbrush, menthol and a whiff of cellar floor carry over to the palate, along with dried cherry and licorice. Astringent tannins provide support.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offers appealing notes of cranberry, cherry and orange peel along with a kiss of vanilla. It's tart and fresh in style with puckering fruit flavors—perfect for the dinner table.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of dark berry, clove, bell pepper and cedar take shape in the glass. The tightly wound palate delivers dried black cherry, espresso, oak and a green note of dried sage alongside astringent tannins. While the tannins need time, the fruit is already starting to dry up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Barrel tones of coconut and woodspice take the lead in front of cranberry and blackberry, with the fruit seeming a bit dried out. It's reserved in style but still fully flavored with sour cherries accented by licorice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Briary plum and cherry cough-drop aromas give way to a crisp, fairly full palate with chewy tannins. Plum and peppery spice flavors are kept simple, while this finishes with some dark-berry character and a touch of bitterness.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Jammy, soft blueberry aromas are a touch green. This is syrupy, heavy and sticky on the palate, with chocolate, prune and peppery flavors. Tannic and heavy on the finish, this is an overweight Malbec that's lush to the point of being fat.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe and fruity, this is packed with black currant juiciness supported by a strong tannic element. Vineyards close to the Gironde estuary give this property a fine location. The smokiness of the wood combines with bright acidity at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Firm and dense, this is a wine with a good future. Its blackberry fruits, smoky dry tannins and touches of wood aging are joined with acidity to bring out a structured character. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This smoky wine has firm tannins and a tough core. The juicy fruit is taking its time develop, although it will provide density and ripe berry fruits in time. The vineyard, created in the early 1980s, is now at peak maturity. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe and perfumed, this is packed with the richness of 2010 along with its structure. It has weight, juicy black and red berry fruits and a tense structure that still needs time. Acidity at the end provides a fresh lift to the essentially firm wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While the wood aging of this wine still shows, it's already balancing out with the ripe black fruits and rich structure. An attractive smoky character is followed by juicy berry flavors and acidity. This is a wine to age, so wait until 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "One of Bordeaux's more memorable labels (orange nymphs supporting a picture of the chateau), Saransot-Dupré is one of a number of chateaus in Listrac with the Dupré suffix. This is a solid wine, chunky in a typical way for the appellation with plenty of black fruits and balanced tannins. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big in flavor and ripeness, this full-bodied wine tastes concentrated and feels lush, almost soft. It smells like boysenberry jam, tastes like dried cherries and dried plums and has a streak of raspberry that lifts it a bit.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Potent black-plum and black-cherry aromas come with a ton of grainy, spicy oak. This is both fresh and bright as well as dark, brawny and roasted in character.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "This savory blend of Sangiovese, Merlot, Alicante and a dollop of Petit Verdot and Colorino delivers core flavors of crushed plum and ripe blackberry, accented with notes of white pepper, clove and dried herbs. It's easy drinking and balanced, with fine-grained tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is unusual for a reserve, in that it's lower in alcohol than the regular bottling, and more cases were produced. The light fruits and herbs—green apple and lemon verbena in particular—are highlighted with tarragon and citrus peel. The complexity compensates for the just-on-the-edge ripeness, and time in 20% new oak adds a buttery note to the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Produced from a selection of small parcels, this perfumed wood-aged wine is big and concentrated while also keeping style and balance.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a ripe, perfumed wine with smooth, generous texture and broad black fruits. An earthy, leathery edge gives extra character, and the suggestion of maturity comes from the wood aging and the ripe berry fruits. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Rogue Valley Pinot is markedly different from more familiar Willamette Valley styles. Though not at all fleshy, it has pretty, sculpted strawberry and raspberry fruit, lightly candied and fully ripened. A wash of butterscotch wraps around the pleasing finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "On the nose, this is challenging: gaseous, oaky aromas of wet cement also contain notes of bitter lettuce, baking spices and general grit. Raw, tannic and abrasive on the palate, this unfolds to offer herbal flavors of berry and plum. Tannic, scratchy, rugged and mildly green on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Muscular, leathery aromas of dark-berry fruits come with a can't-miss animal element. This Grenache-Carignan blend features a powerful grip and grabby texture. Earthy, jammy flavors of raspberry and plum end with herbal accents, dry spice and the taste of bitter black cherry.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Savory meat and vanilla on the nose lead into flavors of cherry, pepper and plum in this well-made, balanced red. Fresh but fruity, the wine has a wave of warming spice and a clean finish that will pair well with grilled meats, salmon and cheeses.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a light-tasting, dry wine with white pepper and fennel aromas, crisp green apple and lemon flavors, and a savory, earthy nuance that adds complexity. Medium bodied and mouth-filling, this interesting wine steps outside the flavor box.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of half Merlot, half Cabernet Sauvignon is rustically earthy and soft, betraying the plush, plummy Merlot. Tight on the finish and medium in weight, it has a black peppery finish that appeals and suggests pairing with well-seasoned meats.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While this wine has an attractive honey character, it is only lightly sweet. It's more about acidity balanced with richness and a wonderful orange-zest character that gives a lift as well as bright aftertaste. The wine needs until 2016 to get its full act together.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This has a very deep red color, spicy aromas like cedar, vanilla and cocoa, and rich, chocolaty, berrylike flavors. While quite full bodied, it's as smooth as velvet due to moderate tannins and soft acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The color is not too deep or too light, showing a red-brick rim. Aromas resemble red cherry and cranberry, while fresh, tart and tangy flavors like cranberry and raspberry combine with firm tannins for a bit of grip in the texture. Lean and medium bodied, it will make a versatile foil for food.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This intriguing wine reflects the typical wild and earthy characteristics of the grape variety. It has smoky, earthy raspberry aromas, plum and pomegranate flavors, a touch of tartness, a smooth texture and medium body. It tastes mature and mellow.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here's a savory, easygoing blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Syrah that opens with aromas of red berry and cooking spice. The fresh palate offers black cherries, crushed strawberries, white pepper and a hint of clove alongside bright acidity and fine-grained tannins. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 80% Nebbiolo and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon aged in barriques, this opens with aromas of bell pepper, cedar and red currant. The palate delivers dried black cherries, coffee, mocha and grilled herbs alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from a series of small parcels, this fruity wine shows the fresh side of Malbec. With its gushing purple color and ripe black-plum juice flavors, it's designed to drink young. Try it from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A barrel-selection from multiple vineyard sources, this offers black cherry fruit highlighted by root beer and black licorice. Aging nine months in 25% new barrels adds pleasant toastiness to the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bordeaux blends show promise in this region. This combination of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37.5% Merlot and 12.5% Cabernet Franc reveals rustic, leathery aromas of crushed Italian herbs, dried red cherries and fresh dill. Once sipped, flavors of fresh-ground coffee, oregano and bay leaf spice a base of cranberry fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a respectably complex nose on this pink wine, with lemonade and pressed plums blending into a wet cement minerality. The palate is very tasty, with flavors of pomegranate, dried rose petals, hibiscus, night jasmine and even a clove-laced mocha element proving quite intriguing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Almost equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon (with slightly more Merlot), this is a reduced and approachable wine. It's slightly syrupy-thick on the palate, juicy in clove, plum and blueberry. A trace of minerality fights for attention around a medium body, finishing fairly quick.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rose petals, violets, red cherries, plums, rhubarb and heavily peppered spices dominate the nose of this tasty wine from a little-known appellation 27 miles inland from Monterey Bay. It's softly textured upon sipping, then acidity shows up and holds through the sip, along with a stemmy tension. Fresh flavors include sour cherries and red berries.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The grapes for this wine from regional pioneer Gary Eberle are nearly equally sourced from three vineyards: Steinbeck, Wine-Bush and CoCaVin. The nose is herbal with sagebrush, oregano and thyme, offering just a bit of black plum fruit. The palate is also full of crushed, dried herbs, proving a touch sour and tarry, with cooked strawberry and dried raspberry fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sourced from vines planted in the 1980s, this tart and steely wine mixes lemongrass and citrus flavors with hints of riper peach. It finishes with suggestions of fresh-brewed tea.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lean aromas of bell pepper and green fruits are not overly intense. This is linear, juicy and tight in frame. Flavors of lime, scallion, caper and dry cider finish racy and scouring. Good mouthfeel is a plus.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is nothing bashful about this wine. It's big, bold and structured. It holds the potential of great fruitiness as well, a solid core that is surrounded by ripe black berries, just a touch of chocolate and wood. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intensely aromatic in spicy black cherry and earthy leather, the Devious Primitivo is more structured than some of Macchia's Zinfandels, more savory than sweet, with tannic grip. Smooth and velvety, it'll impress alongside salumi and other charcuterie.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It opens with fragrances of stone fruit, Granny Smith apple and white almonds. The succulent palate delivers juicy pear, white peach, nutmeg, white almond and mineral alongside crisp acidity. It's nicely balanced with great length and finesse.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from grapes grown in one of the best vineyards in the valley, this Syrah is a particular success, given the challenging vintage. It's tannic, bone dry and zesty in acidity, with deeply extracted blackberry, black currant, charred meat bone and black pepper flavors. The long, rich finish suggests aging. Hold until 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoke accents ripe yellow peaches on the nose of this intensely penetrating kabinett. The palate shocks with luscious mango and melon flavors, layered with bristling mineral accents. It finishes long, with a reverberating astringency.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich and complex, it unfolds with aromas of graphite, barrel smoke, cured meat and berry fruits that settle on a smooth palate with layering and plush tannins. Bright flavors of blackberry, chocolate and cappuccino finish lightly herbal, with a tobacco note and zero heaviness. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This compelling blend of Viognier, Marsanne and Roussanne—aged for three months in 20% new French oak—brings notes of barrel spices, apricot and pear. There's a touch of sweetness to the full -bodied, textured fruit flavors that provides a perfect counterbalance to the sharply defined, lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Initially this wine is smooth and creamy textured. As it opens up it shows a cool, crisp character, with white apple fruits and layers of spice from wood aging. It's an elegant wine, very balanced already, but likely to age for several years. Drink now and until 2020.\n",

      "Rich and full in the mouth, this is a wine with structure, tight minera ltexture and beautifully juicy fruit. The acidity is a strong part of this wine, giving a citrus tang to go over the wood aging. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's nothing shy about this Zin, which showcases both the variety's personality and the wine's terroir. The raspberry, licorice and espresso flavors have a sweet edge of brown sugar. The finish is entirely dry but hot, but that's part of Dry Creek's charm, and suggests pairing with rich, spicy, smoky meats.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An intense and fresh wine that is packed with acidity as well as powerful red fruits. It is breathtakingly fruity at this stage, the structure still developing and giving a delicious perfumed berry character. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lots of purity, with acidity and stony minerality providing earthy balance to the lemon, lime and mango fruit flavors. Thoroughly dry, it's a classy wine to drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This beautiful Pinot Noir is a blend of various vineyards throughout the appellation. It shows classic coastal acidity, dryness and silkiness, with appealing raspberry, red licorice, cola and pomegranate flavors, wrapped into finely ground tannins. Decant and drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The cool 2011 vintage has kept this bottling from being as ripe as previous wines from this producer. It's certainly leaner, but for all that, it's dry, silky and elegantly complex in its own way, with dried raspberry, tea and white pepper flavors. It could surprise after 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The second wine of Château Cheval Blanc is packed with wood flavors and spice. A toasty wine, it also has solid tannins plus fragrant fruitiness. Already the fruit is coming through strongly and it is for medium-term aging. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from Viognier grown in the Gaillac region, this is a rich wine with tropical and yellow fruit flavors. The wood aging shows gently through the fresh fruit and attractive acidity. The wine is ready to drink, but will improve until 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This full-throated wine has layers of black fruits, firm tannins and a dense texture. It is rich, the black plum fruits partnered by dark chocolate and licorice. Wood aging still shows and the wine needs to broaden out even more as it ages. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This marks the first vintage of this Moulis estate under the ownership of the Barton family of Léoville Barton. Already the wine is showing breeding and an understated structure and richness. Lightly perfumed, full of black fruits and integrated tannins, it should age well. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Syrah dominates the blend on this dry, complex red wine. It brings tannins and deep flavors of blackberries and charred meat. One-third of Grenache adds lightness and cherries, while oak contributes the perfect note of toast. The alcohol is high, but it never feels hot, just mouth-filling and warming. It's a polished and complex wine that brings to mind a perfect steak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tannins give a dark, mineral structure. The black fruits, slowly coming through, are still part of this serious purpose, with wood flavors and dry fruits prominent. It still needs aging, so don't drink before 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Because strong toast aromas show through this wine, its attractive full fruit will need time to come through. The wine, with its firm, almost red-wine structure, needs to age until 2016 before drinking.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a powerful, rich blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It has structure, dark tannins, complex red berry fruits and just the right amount of wood aging. With its solid structured foundation that is partnered with the ripe fruits, it's going to age well. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This apricot and honey flavored wine is both rich and fresh. The balance between the sweetness, the botrytis and the acidity is just right. It will go well with blue cheese or pâté. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bone dry, this succulent, citrus-soaked Riesling is a textural marvel. Mixing grapefruit, lime and pear fruit flavors, its racy acidity underscores its complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Named after a 17th-century nun who lived nearby, this wine packs impressive power and concentration. A great weight of solid tannins are paired with luscious red fruits. Its density, dry core and layers of fruit and acidity promise good aging. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is made in the style of the winery's marvelous Finch Hollow Chardonnays, but is just a little less concentrated. Dry, crisp and elegantly clean, it has complex, mineral-infused flavors of tangerines, peaches and limes, enhanced with lots of smoky new oak. It should hold in the bottle through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Showing richness, this wine is smooth and well balanced between ripe red berry fruits and generous tannins. The wood aging shows in a slight burnt edge, but this will pass as the wine develops. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This rich, youthful wine is another example of Lugana that is aging gracefully and has more to give. It opens with aromas of citrus, dried apricots and flint that carry over to the palate together with lemon drop, grapefruit and pear, plus fresh acidity. A mineral note marks the start of the long finish. Drink now through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Some wood aging has rounded out this fruity wine. But it has not radically changed its inherent fresh, crisp character. It shows apples, lemon and lime juice and just a touch of spice from wood. The wine is ready to drink but will be best if left until 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Still firmly tannic, this wine is densely structured and shows good potential. It has dark tannins and rich berry fruits, followed by a more juicy aftertaste. With power and style combining well, it should be aged. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With a licorice, chemise and cherry-laden nose reminiscent of a hillside hike through the chaparral in the morning dew, this wine is rather tannic on entry, tending toward chamomile tea with cranberry fruit. With a strong tannic backbone, it could drink well for awhile.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raw, lightly leafy red-berry aromas properly announce what amounts to a juicy, snappy Tempranillo with berry, spice and dry oak flavors. A dry feeling, peppery tasting finish is traditional for good, basic Spanish table wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "All stainless fermented, this seems to show some residual sugar, perhaps in order to round out the austere acidity. Lemon and tangerine fruit—all with plenty of acid—are annotated with highlights of fresh cilantro. It would be a fine match for simple, white fish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Candied red-berry aromas are pasty at first, with a twinge of green. In the mouth, this is wiry and jammy feeling, with juicy acids. Herbal, slightly green flavors of olive, toast and berry fruits finish minty and a bit hot.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tight, nervy and mineral, this crisp and fruity wine needs a few months to develop fully. It's lively with citrus fruits, an herbaceous character and steely aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blackberry liqueur, violet, cola and slight dustiness form the nose of this well-priced wine. The flavors are a bit thinner than expected, most reminiscent of ripe pomegranate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pretty aromas suggest plum, red berry, leather, graphite and eucalyptus. The understated palate isn't as expressive as the nose, but reveals subdued black cherry, black pepper, espresso and oak. Astringent tannins still need to integrate, but for now leave the mouth feeling dried out. Drink after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Red Pony brand is putting out reliably distinct wines. This one smells of cranberry, oregano and barnyard. The tannins and acidity are solid, with strawberry and pomegranate flavors leading to an earthy finish. Hold until 2016 for an even smoother time.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with aromas of toasted oak, espresso and a hint of tire rubber. The palate displays sweet black cherry extract layered with milk chocolate, coffee and oak alongside bracing tannins and racy acidity. Drink after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The lightest wine in the winery's well-crafted lineup, this marries grapefruity acidity to tart cherry fruit. It's nicely balanced, airy and a pleasure to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This tight, young wine is shot through with steely acidity and minerality. It tastes of the flinty soil of Pouilly, full in the mouth and concentrated. Give it until 2015 before drinking.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crafted entirely from estate-grown fruit, this tart, citrus-flavored rosé is anchored in rhubarb and strawberry flavors. It offers medium concentration and length, with a subtle suggestion of cola woven into the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raspberry and plum aromas start with a resiny oak covering that turns foresty and briary with airing. This is raisiny and ripe in feel, with a complex mix of berry, fennel and anise flavors. A lush, dense-feeling finish is minty and herbal.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This tastes of warmer Russian River Valley climes, darker and riper in black cherry and berry fruit character with a layering of toasty cinnamon and oak. The aroma tends to the earthy/pastoral.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "As is often the case with Oregon's 2011 Pinots, this remains stubbornly tight, and shows herbal and stem flavors rather than pretty fruit. That said, it also displays the excellent structure of the better wines from the vintage. Underpinnings of acid and tannin, plus the still sharp-edged pomegranate fruit, may carry it up to 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This comes from estate-grown fruit in the Chehalem Mountains AVA. Spicy and sharp-toned, it brings tart acidity and highlights of orange peel to flavors of wild mountain berries. The tannins are still a bit rough, but should smooth out with more bottle age.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It's the hard, granite rock of the vineyards that gives this wine its tight, firm texture. It is very crisp, structured with tense acidity and strong lemon-lime flavors. The wine, with its intense freshness, is very much made to partner food.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A new label for MacMurray Ranch, this Pinot Gris is stony in fresh nectarine, pear and mango, wrapped in a creamy texture that develops fleshy flavors of fig in the glass. The fruit is sourced from both MacMurray Ranch and Gallo's cooler Russian River Valley outpost, Two Rock, near Petaluma.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine offers a lighter side of Petite Sirah. It conveys more red fruit than brooding black and blue, a taste of red licorice and lean, balanced red cherries sleekly layered over earthy plum and spice. Its structure and acidity make it food-friendly, ready to accent a black pepper steak or similarly seasoned roast.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Exotic incense, sandalwood and ripe berry aromas waft from the glass of this single-vineyard Barbaresco. The palate is initially closed but slowly reveals crunchy Morello cherry, toast and espresso alongside assertive tannins. Drink after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pure berry aromas define the nose on this highly drinkable Garnacha-Syrah blend. In the mouth, it's clean, juicy, a bit round and easy to process. Typical Aragónese flavors of plum and berry finish tasty and unbroken.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This respected Bierzo producer's base-level Mencía is jumpy on the nose, with floral berry and plum aromas. It feels fresh and bright, with ample structure. Standard berry, plum and currant flavors come with notes of spice, while the finish is forward and fresh.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Floral and pretty in ripe peach and pineapple/mango, it unwinds with a finish of vanilla.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Finished (apparently) off-dry, this seems to show some residual sugar in a leesy, yeasty style. The fruit suggests pears and cotton candy, with juicy acidity supporting the sweetness. Don't look for your standard dry Pinot Gris, but what's here is generous and enjoyable.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Petite Sirah-led blend offers cherry, cedar and smoke, with a bit of morel mushroom funk on the nose. The palate reveals tobacco, plum jam and harder-than-expected tannins, with a slight vanilla finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a smooth, easy-drinking and rather light-bodied wine, not unusual in the tricky vintage of 2011. Relatively light in color, this offers scents of sweet cherry, vanilla and cinnamon, while the flavors recall cherry and raspberry. The texture is almost delicate but livened up with a good touch of acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Varietally specific aromas of wild flowers, honey and lemon verbena set up an unctuous, creamy palate with modest acidity and lots of weight. Honey, mango, vanilla and other sweet, tropical flavors finish thick but not quite cloying. This is a unique wine for Navarra that deserves to be judged on its own.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plum, vanilla, chocolate and subtle oak aromas carry over to the palate. The palate displays chocolate-covered cherries, fig and coffee alongside bracing tannins that leave a drying finish. Drink 2018–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is aggressively tart and herbal, but shows good density and concentration. Flavors of lemon verbena mixed with lime-ade run true and full on through an extended, focused finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pastoral and earthy, it's straightforward and tightly woven in tannins, with balanced acidity that offers a sense of wild strawberries. A well-made wine priced attractively; stock up for midweek needs.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of citrus, white stone fruit and a vegetal hint suggesting tomato leaf lead the way. The racy palate offers grapefruit, pineapple, fresh white peach and flinty mineral while a pleasantly bitter note closes the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh fruit flavors suggest a bowl full of berries and cherries. Crisp acids help to focus the wine, with spot-on varietal flavors and balance. Both elegant and complex, it's a lovely bottle from an under-the-radar producer.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This delicate Hungarian white wine is a blend of 86% Furmint, 9% Yellow Muscat and 5% Kabar. It has enticing aromas of white flowers, botrytis, gardenia, apple blossom and apricot that prepare your palate for flavors of peach juice, citrus zest, grapefruit juice, caramelized pineapple and a crisp clean finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In a classic combination of ripe flavors and lip-smacking structure, this full-bodied wine wraps concentrated black cherry and mint aromas and generous cherry and blackberry flavors in muscular tannins that keep the texture fresh.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tar and beef char kick off the nose on this dark and heavy wine, which offers asphalt, smoked meats and crushed elderberry. Caramelized beef, balsamic-blackberry reduction, tobacco and touches of smoke show on the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of pear, Spanish broom, flint and Mediterranean herb emerge in the glass. The juicy, medium-bodied palate offers ripe apple, peach and lime alongside fresh acidity and a mineral vein. A hazelnut note marks the close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The man who makes a million Syrahs dives into a blend of 60% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre and 15% Syrah on this bottling, which offers composting lilac, black pepper, fresh boysenberry, dried herb and a tarry quality on the nose. There's a strong blackberry-balsamic reduction flavor once sipped, as well as beef char, elderberry and more tar.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pineapple and lime peel start the nose of this layered Assyrtiko. On the palate, it unfolds with a combination of lemon peel, grapefruit and sea salt. This wine can age for several years but is good to drink now; pair with lamb, fresh fish or Asian cuisine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Loads of clove, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg spice show up the strawberry, blueberry and red cherry aromas of this lavish bottling, which also offers scents of crushed rock and turned earth. Similar elements entertain the palate, culminating with a minty pine needle note, proving to be a very dynamic sip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Huckleberry and dark cherry mingle around a viscosity of velvety texture and tannin, dusted in notions of black tea, tar and red currant. Light in color, but bold in flavor, this wine speaks to both the cool nature of its vineyard site, and to the style of the winemaker.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smooth, medium-bodied layers of pomegranate, red currant and a refreshing sense of citrus make for a light, food friendly companion, especially with the wine's satisfying bite of acidity and lengthy finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The grapes for this full-bodied wine hail from the Luvisi Vineyard in the heart of Calistoga old-vine country—a warm and welcome site for the variety. Baked blackberry and black olive combine around a taste of charred meat before brawny spins of brown sugar and nutmeg play on the palate with jolts of chocolate and vanilla.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a creamy, thick and food friendly white with highlights of honey and green apple and a lingering decadence of ginger, just hinting at anise. Medium-bodied, it represents the vintage and the appellation well, at a price that's nice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A majority of Grenache and tiny bit of Mourvèdre from Kick Ranch and McGah Vineyard were racked to concrete egg for fermentation, with the intent of preserving freshness. Successful in that quest, this orange-pink wine is dry, tangy and well-integrated in terms of acidity, subtle in cranberry, dried cherry and orange, with a light, refreshing finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The slightest notes of angelica and kiwi fruit lend perfume to a slender, almost weightless body. This slinky Sylvaner runs rings around you, intriguing with its weightless charm. It's dry, lithe and refreshing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of mature dark-skinned berry, fennel, toast and baking spice come together in the glass. The taut, focused, palate shows ripe black cherry, red raspberry, mineral and licorice while fresh acidity and firm tannins provide balance. Drink 2019 through 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spicy and lightly peppery, this fresh rosé brings concentrated strawberry fruit into focus. Made from organically grown grapes, it expands into a full-bodied finish with a lick of milk chocolate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A fresh green-floral touch persists throughout this refreshing dry Silvaner. Light-footed in style, it offers crisp green-plum flavor accented by zippy flashes of lime and lemon zest. The finish is invigorating and brisk.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here is the most engaging offering of the winery's 2013 single vineyard Pinots. It's bright with red-berry fruit and tropical-candy highlights. Meyer lemon peeks in, and the tangy fruit flavors continue into a finish of medium weight and length. Drink now and over the next couple of years.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Grated lime zest on the nose leads to an uncompromisingly but refreshingly brisk palate. This has freshness and a stony, almost chalky depth and wonderful concentration and freshness. It's dry, brisk and invigorating.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A bit stiff, this expresses its terroir with accents of earth and clay around muted red fruits. Streaks of sassafras, coconut and vanilla emerge as the wine breathes open. Decant this one for at least an hour or two.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a real tongue-stainer, earthy and packed with purple fruits. Flavors of blueberries, plums, bitter chocolate and charred wood abound. The wine remains lively with ample acidity and smooth, though dense tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This well-made wine blends in a hearty 17% Petite Sirah, providing additional power and dusty berry flavor. Sultry and velvety on the palate, it's spicy and peppery in subtle measure, with a juicy cheeriness on the lengthy finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A new offering made entirely from estate fruit, this is a selection of the best blocks and barrels of the vintage, with its core component being 90% Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon. The remainder is Zinfandel. Together they provide black color and a whiff of bay leaf and peppercorn, around well-integrated layers of black cherry, vanilla and black tea.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Peppery leather opens up this wine, blended with 5% Mourvèdre. More savory than fruity, it pleases in big tannin weight and length, with an intensity of brambly wildness and a sagey, smoky edge.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Typical for this winery, this smells a bit herbal, with tomato and earthy plum aromas leading the way. Scratchy, grabby tannins support savory, herbal berry flavors. Hard tannins struggle to resolve themselves on a firm, muscular finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a ripe, earthy, modern-leaning Rioja with aromas of blackberry, raisin and rubber. Soft and fleshy on the palate, what this easygoing number lacks in structure is made up for in charm. Ultraripe flavors of plum and berry come with a chocolaty accent, while the finish is smooth and tastes earthy and spicy. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Brilliant, pure fruit flavors light up this full-bodied but easy-to-drink wine. Cherry, strawberry and something deeper like black currant dance through the aromas and coat the tongue with their richness. The texture is smooth and plush due to fine tannins and mild acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark shades of bramble and smoked nuts lend a shadowy mystique to this unusual Schwartzriesling, otherwise known as Pinot Meunier. Full bodied yet elegant, the palate boasts tart blackberry and raspberry flavors framed in finely grained tannins. A rare chance to experience this grape as a single varietal wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy berry and raisin aromas announce a warm, ripe wine. This feels plump, grapy and chunky, with moderate acidity. Grapy, bold flavors of raspberry, prune and cherry are earthy and loamy, while ripeness and a raisiny element carry onto the finish. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 60% Syrah, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot, this inky garnet-colored wine offers aromas of cassis and elderberry. On the palate, there is a combination of cooked fruit and cool spice flavors yet there is no lack of accompanying acidity. Flavors of cassis, elderberry, anise, orange peel and vanilla are backed by silky tannins that stay smooth into the cooling finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Scorched earth, cured meat, toasted nut and grilled herb aromas lead the nose on this full-bodied red. The warm, ripe palate doles out raspberry jam, mature black cherry, vanilla and star anise framed in firm, velvety tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas of herbs, pencil lead and blue and red fruit are forward, fresh and appealing. The flavors follow similarly, showing depth and balance uncommon for a wine this price.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The picturesque name of the wine, the vineyard where God sits, comes from a monopole—a walled property in the hills behind Beaune, wholly owned by the Château de Santenay. Ripe and smooth with an attractive, crisp texture, the wine is ready to drink. A touch of toast gives extra interest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tilled soil, forest floor, mature black-skinned fruit, leather and a truffle note come together in the glass. The firmly structured palate presents juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, vanilla and an earthy hint of game while assertive, close-grained tannins provide support. Give it a few years for the tannins to relax then enjoy. Drink 2019–2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A majority of Grenache plays lead here, with an accompaniment of 35% Syrah and 12% Mourvedre. Concentrated in a grip of leather, there's further integration of earth and black fruit that stays bright and vibrant on the palate, a medium-bodied coming-together of savory with ripe.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Produced from 25-year-old vines, this is a fresh as well as ripe wine, well balanced between herbal flavors and white and citrus fruitiness. It has a rounded texture that is juicy as well as full in the mouth. The wine is ready to drink.\n",

      "Complexities of mushroom, caramel and brioche lend a haze of maturity over delicate strawberry and cherry notes in this Champagne-style sparkling,which was aged for eight years over lees. Tiny, persistent bubbles spread seamlessly on the palate, accentuated by streaks of racy acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Always an eye-opening bottling, this blends 50% Sangiovese with 50% Syrah. This vintage shows cooked blackberries, baked plums, balsamic vinaigrette and black rocks on the nose. The palate is juicy and energetic, blending dark fruit with bright acidity, coffee and caramel flavors, with strong tannins for structure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Buy this for its balance and welcome sense of restraint that gives way to richness on the finish. Crisp apple and light citrus aromas, then nicely concentrated and similar flavors, put an attractive spin on this medium-bodied, fresh and appealing wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "What Baumard describes as a “secret blend” from its vineyards, this wine is both sweet and fresh. Honey and intense acidity are filled out with baked apple and lemon-marmalade flavors. It is ready to drink in all its fresh glory.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Guigal does a terrific job with its regional wines, and this rosé is no exception. Notes of crushed stone and underripe pineapple broaden out into red berries and white chocolate on the weighty but balanced palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Layered aromas and rich but vibrant flavors help this medium-bodied wine stand out. It has a medium color with a brickish rim, while aromas suggest black tea and black cherry. A dry, tangy, but ripe fruit expression on the tongue lingers on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of earthy, nutty, mature berry fruits come with a hint of raisin and a touch of compost. This saturated Vino de Cádiz is composed of 80% Syrah, with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's a heavy wine with flavors of vanilla, burnt wood, blackened spices and stewed berries. The finish tastes peppery, dark and outright woody. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend from Cádiz features Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's big, ripe and minty on the nose, with hints of animal fur and leather. A blocky, full palate weighs in at 15.5%, while flavors of oak and vanilla blend well with spiced berry fruit. A drying finish tastes mostly of oak. Drink through 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From older vines on the producer's estate, this wine has a depth of richness to the nose and is intensely powerful in gingerbread and Meyer lemon on the medium-bodied palate. Lemony acidity rounds out the finish, flecked in butter.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is much buzz about this new Steve and Chrystal Clifton (of Palmina and Brewer-Clifton) project that finds inspiration for wine from music. This orange-mauve-pink rosé is redolent with the familiar Pinot components of cherry, sagebrush and clove. On the palate, iron, graphite and wild herbs spice up the pomegranate fruit. It's very varietally pure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a brawny, strongly powerful wine, fully displaying the grip of mountain fruit. Blackberry and black currant complement the tobacco and cedar. Drink now through 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% varietal wine offers plenty of crisp cranberry, currant and restrained red fruit on the palate, the texture soft and supple. A pleasing shock of dark chocolate appears on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Leather and peppercorn jump from the glass in this soft, strong wine, powerful in tannin and dusty earth. A gravelly, rocky component plays on the palate around waves of chocolate and black currant, finishing in herb.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 60% Montepulciano and 40% Sangiovese, this is a grippy, leathery wine, the fruit sourced from two different sites in the appellation. Black leather, baked and dried plum, and cherry combine on the palate with breadth and length, finishing as if dusted in cocoa.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Red berry, chopped herb, blue flower and menthol all come together on this elegantly structured red. The juicy, accessible palate offers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and a hint of vanilla alongside round tannins. Drink through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoky, oaky, rubbery aromas are sophisticated and inviting. This blend of 90% Garnacha and 10% Carignan feels smooth, but with a healthy pulse. Plum and cherry flavors carry a note of oaky char, while a long, toasty finish offers a complex note of cured meat. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the heart of the Rutherford Bench, this estate-grown wine is a classic version of restraint and elegance, structured in dusty tannin with bursts of cedar, tomato leaf and cassis. Cabernet Franc makes up 8% of the blend, with 3% Merlot. This will benefit from time in the cellar; drink 2020–2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Complex and well balanced, this wine shows enticing aromas of fruits, spices and subtle herbs followed by tangy, dry, and slightly lean flavors like cranberry and rhubarb. It will be great with a roast fowl of some kind and should mellow more with time. Best after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Decadent and candied, this is an oaky, well-made wine with richness at its core. Tahitian vanilla, caramel and Meyer lemon give way to more weighty tropical characteristics, making for a ripe, bigger-styled wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This mid-sized négociant has turned out a solid Tavel. It's classic red-berry hue is typical for the appellation, followed by ample weight on the palate and bold cherry-berry flavors—all wrapped up by a long, mouthwatering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This ambitious blend of 60% Sangiovese, 15% Merlot, 15% Petite Sirah and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon largely succeeds, with aromas of tight blueberries, concentrated purple flowers and a touch of crushed peppercorn. The fruit-driven palate is dense with blueberry, tart boysenberry and a dusting of cocoa.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is a big one, going all out to make friends. New-oak aromas like clove, cedar and cinnamon explode out of the glass, then flavors of dark chocolate and cherry spread across the palate for a generous—almost thick—impression. Fine layers of tannins and firm acidity blanket the texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This late harvest wine reminds one of lemon grass, cut grass and honeysuckle. It is sweet with a good acid balance along with flavors of lemon meringue pie and lemon curd.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Clean, crisp and bright, this was fermented in stainless (with just 10% in neutral wood), and not put through malolactic. The blend is 60/40 Chardonnay/Pinot Noir, yielding fresh fruit flavors of apple and melon that are focused and precise. A streak of ginger runs through racy acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Firm and focused, this lightly spiced effort supports its tart cherry fruit with ample acidity. Hints of toasted coconut build in the finish. A few more years of bottle age should bring further integration.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A striking shade of amber/orange, this soft and fruity wine is open and loose knit, with broad flavors of mature, slightly oxidized tree fruits, plus lightly spicy notes of cinnamon and baking spices. It's very well made, but well apart from any standard approach.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A delicate streak of honeycomb gilds layers of yellow peaches, apples and tangerines in this off-dry Riesling. Its concentrated fruitiness is lip smacking, but it's also quite elegant, reverberating long on a steely strike of acidity and minerality. Drink now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mature black fruit, toast and spice aromas lead the nose. The firm palate is still tightly wound, offering baked black cherry, licorice and espresso balanced by youthfully assertive, taut tannins. Drink after 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crushed rose, pressed violet, perfumed berry, sage and a balsamic note are just some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied red. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, black pepper and licorice alongside tightly knit tannins and the subtle warmth of alcohol. Give it a few more years to come together. Drink 2018–2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A nose of wild blackberry and brambles lays the groundwork for a tender dance of fruit and herbal flavors, especially blackberry, pomegranate, eucalyptus and fennel bulb. Mouth-coating tannins dissipate on the finish, joined by a burst of tart pomegranate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an unusual, exotic take on Malbec. The bouquet delivers cardamom, sandalwood and spiced black currant aromas. In the mouth, it's grabby with pinching tannins. Blueberry and cardamom flavors end ripe, with decent follow through. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This falls sbetween a rosé and an orange wine in its appearance, a pale salmon/copper shade that results from 36 hours of skin contact before pressing. Scents of hibiscus tea and rosewater put a delicate top note ahead of rich, ripe, round and spicy citrus fruit. A strong impression of cinnamon marks the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Red rose, wild berry, toast, tobacco and a whiff of underbrush meld in the glass. On the firm palate, notes of clove, ground pepper, cinnamon, anise and mocha accent the red berry core. Firm, fine-grained tannins offer structure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe borderline raisiny aromas include earth, cedar and graphite scents. This is concentrated, grabby and fully extracted. Flavors of jammy black fruits blend with spicy saucy notes prior to a finish with flavors of tomato, herbs, salt and gamy meat. Firm acidity guarantees this will last at least another five years before falling off.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of perfumed berry, mint baking spice, toast and espresso waft out of the glass. The palate is tight and rather primary at the moment, showing raw black cherry, raspberry, clove and toasted notes. It's still young but balanced, with fresh acidity and firm, fine–grained tannins. Drink 2016–2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A field blend of 85% Zinfandel, 11% Alicante Bouschet and 4% Petite Sirah, this juicy, spicy wine is robust and full bodied. Blackberry syrup and black cherry combine around cinnamon and black pepper, finishing in a wave of power.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh and refined, this delightful, easy-drinking wine opens with scents of rose, woodland berry and a whiff of dark cooking spice. The vibrant, savory palate offers juicy red cherry, raspberry and white pepper alongside bright acidity and polished tannins. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Monbazillac, with its impressive castle, is part of the Bergerac region that makes some beautiful dessert wines. This wine, with its refreshing balance between acidity and rich honeyed flavors, conveys Seville orange marmalade and lemon acidity, with a smooth, botrytis aftertaste. Drink now, or better age until 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Named after the winemaker, Amélie Couillard, this soft, rounded wine is smooth with creamed apple flavors while also having a proper tangy of acidity. That tight and tangy edge makes the wine refreshing now while also allowing it to age for a few more months. Drink now or from late 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is very structured and firm. With some barrel aging, the tannins have been smoothed out although the wine remains with a dry core and fresh acidity. Black-currant flavors dominate, giving a wine that is bright and fruity at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An impressive blend of Merlot and Malbec, this is a solid, dark wine packed with both tannins and ripe berry fruits. It has a serious character with toast, acidity and complex spice flavors. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This ripe wine with open fruits has 40% Cabernet Franc in the blend, which lends an attractive perfumed character and gives the wine rich character and fruitiness. It will age for a few more years and be ready to drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Roast beef, grape candy, cracked blueberry, beef char and grapy freshness come to the nose on this bottling. The candied grape and blueberry elements carry dark-fruit character to the palate, along with licorice that gives depth. Roasting herbs in the midpalate adds savory flair.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "At David Hill, the Winemakers Cuvée is a cut above the reserve. It's a muscular blend of scents and flavors of lavender, cherry and chocolate wrapped into a firm, focused finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wild berry, grilled herb, aniseed and a hint of vanilla are some of the aromas you'll find on this attractive red. The linear, elegantly structured palate offers ripe black cherry, raspberry, licorice and grilled sage while a tobacco note closes the firm finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Waxy apple stars in this brisk, approachable white from a single estate-farmed block, the oak briny and salty in toast and honey. Textured and elegantly light bodied, it finishes with a satisfying note of lemon candy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pristine white peaches seem suspended in a crystalline solution of river rocks and mineral water in this refreshing dry Pinot Blanc. It's delicate in stature but abounds in elegance. Drink now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raspberry, rose petal, baking spice, tilled soil and new leather aromas unfold on this structured red. The chewy, full-bodied palate doles out juicy wild cherry, menthol and dark cooking spice while assertive tannins and fresh acidity lend balance. Drink 2019–2029.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Merlot, this was built to be approachable young. Grapes are sourced from an estate, organically farmed vineyard as well as two neighboring properties, Pickberry and Murray Ranch. Tobacco forms around a juiciness of blackberry and raspberry, giving it a sultry edge, while maintaing soft tannins throughout.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smooth, deep aromas of licorice and blackberry are composed. This Mencía feels full and lusty, with grip but nothing too hard or edgy. Earthy black fruit flavors are savory, toasty and meaty, while the finish is woody and plump. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Despite its richness, this is a stylish wine that exudes freshness as much as dense fruit and structure. A blend of Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, all structured varieties, it still yields a generous full-bodied and rounded wine. It does need to age, so drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sourced from the southeastern section of the Rutherford appellation and 100% varietal, this is a seamlessly made wine, luxurious in cherry pie and leather saddle. Tangy acidity meets the dusty tannins head-on, finishing with a burst of orange zest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While barrel-influenced and full-bodied, this unctuous wine remains crisp in edgy acidity, with lean flavors of lemon and grapefruit amidst a deeper, richer background of oak and caramel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Freshly cut quince, guava, lemongrass and key lime aromas combine with a stony quality on the nose of this vibrant, zesty wine. Its acidity is almost effervescent, infusing the palate with boundless energy, while its chalky grip carries sharp green apple notes alongside warmer touches of pineapple and guava. Those vivid flavors linger for a full minute.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright raspberry, cherry and rose petal aromas meet cola spice on the pretty, delicate nose of this bottling—a solid example of the surge in quality of Central Coast Grenache. There is a tense tannic structure to the palate despite its light nature, with great acidity presenting tangy red and purple fruit flavors, with more rose petal accents.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This stellar reserve remains one of the finest Chardonnays from Oregon. Meyer lemon, peanut oil, salted nuts, citrus and tangerine combine in a deep and intense palate. Whole-cluster pressed and barrel fermented (but in just 10% new French oak), this delicious, dense and penetrating wine should be consumed now through the early 2020s.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The most recent of Palliser's Great Dog releases, the 2014 Ted is a full-bodied, muscular wine. Cola, cinnamon and thyme notes mark the nose, while the flavors feature dark cherries and plums, drawing to a lingering close with echoes of mocha and Mexican chocolate. Drink 2020–2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a golden, mature and sweet wine that comes from the white wine appellation of the Madiran region. It balances ripe apricot and honey with intense acidity to create a beautiful wine. The zesty marmalade and final crispness are delicious. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An attractive silver-pink colored wine, this is beautifully ripe and fruity. It has a great balance between acidity and raspberry fruit. There is a herbal edge that gives the wine a fine tangy character. Drink this wine from the end of 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wood-aged wine is a fascinating example of how rosé can age. It is certainly mature and has lost its crisp fruitiness. But it has gained toast, a smooth rich texture and plenty of spice. It's obviously a food wine, ready to drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dense tannins and powerful black fruits reinforce the almost-black color of the wine. It is a strong wine, powered by dark plums, rich tannins and very fine acidity. Produced from organic grapes, it is an impressive wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wreaths of smoke surround pretty raspberry aromatics. The red and plummy purple-fruit flavors continue, along with some tannic muscle and grip. This is a mix of 667 and Pommard clones—still young and a bit tight.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This was the first winery to make a truly white Pinot Noir (back in 2004). Produced exclusively from Pommard clones, it's barrel fermented and aged much like a Chardonnay. Along with great texture and length, there's plenty of acid supporting its palate-pleasing mix of white peach, melon and gooseberry. It finishes with a thread of lightly buttery caramel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Like many of the winery's bottlings, this wine shows rich but balanced concentration. Loamy and fulfilling baked blueberry and blackberry aromas are laced with vanilla. The palate is lavish as well, with strong blueberry syrup, herb and pepper flavors and a caramel touch on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ivy leaf and ripe, green pear notes make up this wine's enticing nose. The palate brims with juicy pear and citrus, feeling concentrated, lively and moreish. Dry and streamlined with citrus, it also layers pear and peach fruit before finishing with lip-smacking citrus zest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark cherry and cola aromas meld with composting rose scents on the nose of this pleasing wine that will satisfy any lover of Pinot Noir. The palate exudes nutmeg, iron and rose flavors galore, adding spice to its core of plump raspberry and ripe cranberry fruit. Lively acidity and tannic depth complete the experience.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A hearty swirl in the glass wakes up this wine's aroma, showing lemon balm, cress and green pear. Those fresh flavors also play on the lithe palate, where yeasty savoriness is enhanced by lemony spritz. It's totally zippy and refreshing, with far more concentration than is at first apparent, proving it needs time to breathe.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the reserve-level Pinot Gris, comprised of lots from five different vineyards. Juicy, succulent and quite tart fruit flavors emphasize fresh apples and pears, lightly dusted with cinnamon spice. The concentration and lingering finish prove it worthy of its reserve status.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This new offering, made by Ross Cobb and Katy Wilson, is intended as a “best of the west.” Sourced from several vineyards, it reveals true coastal qualities, with ethereal earthiness and an Old World sensibility. Cloudy in the glass, it shows cranberry, orange, bay leaf and tea flavors as it unwinds.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bryan Babcock makes plenty of more expensive Pinot Noirs, but this appellation blend hits all the right notes and shows off the results of the “pedestular cane suspension” technique he's been using in the vineyard. Wild thyme, sagebrush and bay leaf meet cranberry and slate aromas on the nose. Black raspberry and cranberry flavors lead the earthy palate, accented with nettle and peppercorn.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 25% whole cluster bottling from the Full Draw Vineyard shows black cherry, leather, cola and sarsaparilla scents on the nose. Cherry cola and vanilla flavors mark the palate, where medium acidity and persistent tannins ensure solid cellaring potential. Drink 2018–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In French, the vineyard name means “the meadow on the mountain,” a fitting name for the site. This is a spicy wine, with a touch of red-hot candy. The pretty cherry fruit is underscored with earth and mineral, and the astringent, tea-flavored tannins morph into a suggestion of cola at the tail end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Almost white in color, this is a rich wine with intense red-currant and raspberry fruits. It is a dry wine, destined to partner food, with fine acidity as well as a herbal edge. It is a concentrated wine, ready to drink from the end of 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The top wine from this estate is impressive. It has rich black fruits and firm tannins, showing its youthfulness. Its weight and concentration combine with the ripe fruits to give a wine that is destined for long-term aging. Négrette, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon go into this fine blend. Drink it from 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crisp, refreshing and uniquely spicy and mineral-driven, this blends 50% Sauvignon blanc, 25% Ribolla Gialla, 20% Sémillon and 5% Tocai Friulano—all unusual varieties in the Napa Valley. Light, bright and fleshy, it tastes of lemon, mango and the sea.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blends 52% Chardonnay and 48% Pinot Noir in a seamless, focused package of bright acidity, moderate mousse and tangled peach, tangerine and blood orange flavors. It has impressive complexity and length, with a nutty note that closes out the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a hearty version of a grape frequently made in a simpler, fresh style, showing roasted red berry, charcoal and mocha aromas on the nose. A deep cassis flavor permeates the palate, with beef char and black pepper accents that make for a compelling, rather lavish sip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This attention-grabber hits the palate with reckless abandon. Stewed black plum and sugar plum aromas meet vanilla and strawberry pie scents on the lush nose. It's plush with creamy coffee, milk chocolate, blackberry and black cherry flavors, framed by soft tannins and a fine streak of acidity. Rather delicious.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Though labeled Willamette Valley, this is single vineyard Chehalem Mountains AVA fruit. Smooth, ripe and buttery, from sniff to swallow, it's loaded with Satsuma orange, Meyer lemon and pink-grapefruit flavors. The acids snap and the finish lingers, with a streak of vanilla and a slight sensation of heat.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a very limited bottling of 80% Cabernet Franc and 20% Merlot. Roughly half spent time in new French oak, which brings a lovely toasty note into the foreground. There's a slight, not unpleasant funkiness, along with dusty baking spices, black cherry and currant, and a chunk of dark chocolate. It's big, bold and delicious, and drinking quite well at the moment.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bottling from Syrah legend Bob Lindquist, sourced from the biodynamic vineyard that he planted, delivers snappy boysenberry, white pepper, rosemary and lavender aromas. The palate judiciously balances savory, peppery spice and lush purple floral notes with tangy black plum fruit and rosehip accents, making for a wondrous sip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Loads of ripe blackberry and boysenberry aromas lead to a plush, not quite soft mouthfeel laced with berry, cherry, clove and cinnamon flavors. It's a very generous, mouth-filling wine that will bring a lot of enjoyment.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "A typical Douro blend of Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Tinta Barroca, this wine is all about bright, crisp fruit. Black and red currant flavors come with tight acidity and a juicy character. Tightly wound now, it needs a few more months to calm down. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of Chardonnay, Garganega and Sauvignon, this has aromas of peach and golden apple. The simple palate offers pineapple and banana alongside bright acidity. Enjoy soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with subdued aromas of espresso, grilled herb, scorched underbrush and French oak. The lean evolved palate shows roasted coffee bean, a hint of oak-driven spice and a salty note but the fruit has already dried up, leaving an abrupt, astringent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas of vanilla, herb and cherry show some volatility. The cherry flavors are light, finishing tart.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Gritty aromas suggest burnt popcorn and match stick. This is a round oily style of Torrontés with briny tropical fruit flavors. A salty note of persimmon carries an O.K. finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A French version of a brand that is more familiar in Chile as Viña San Esteban, this wine has more stylistically to do with South America than southwest France. It is soft, juicy, rounded and with attractive ripe tannins. The wine is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of roasted but slightly weedy berry fruits, road tar and latex precede a raw shallow pulling palate. This Malbec tastes of salty and savory black plums, tomatoes and herbs. On the finish, this delivers mostly spaghetti-sauce flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A light wine with attractive berry flavors, this has a touch of caramel to go with its fruitiness and crisp acidity. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "If you like your Sauvignon Blanc herbal, then this is the wine for you. It's very fruity and New World in style, has tight acidity and is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Composed of 62% Sauvignon Blanc and 38% Sémillon, Bianca's White is minimally oaked and somewhat extreme in its acidity, with an intensity of tart flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This pleasant, fruity wine has lemon-lime crispness. Hints of apricot flavor prove the Alvarinho grape is far from its northern Portuguese homeland. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of Arinto and Fernão Pires is soft and bland. Its light fruit and acidity feel open and ripe.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is floral and spicy on the nose, but lacks the richness on the midpalate to fully support those ambitions. The result is a highly perfumed but modestly flavored wine with medium body and a dusty finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Floral berry and plum aromas are also saucy and oaky, and thus discordant. A wobbly tannic palate with green herbal oaky blueberry flavors tastes grassy on the finish. If you know Casarena's wines, this fits the mold.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Off the bat, this smells a bit like fruit punch, although with time it stiffens. A chunky heavy somewhat flat palate tastes of clove, chocolate and berry and plum.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Reduced and dominated by tannin and oak, this large production offering is earthy and spicy, with full-bodied texture and weight. It finishes slightly green.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This soft, yeasty and sweet blend of Fernão Pires and Bical is fruity with apple and pear flavors. It has just enough acidity to keep it crisp on the finish and makes an easy apéritif.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This dry, tart wine smells like sliced apples and has lemon pastry-like flavors without the sweetness. The palate is full-bodied but cut with a zing of lemon and green apple.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is soft and fruity with hints of honey as well as mango and peach flavors. It is lightly perfumed leaving room for a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Vague apple, pear and lime pith aromas show on the subdued nose of this bottling. The palate is pleasant, with dried apple, lime peel and grass flavors, but it's somewhat lacking in energy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Low-intensity apple and pear aromas lead to a tight high-acid mouth. Severe flavors of lemon and lime are fairly sour. A long direct finish is linear and shearing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Jammy aromas and equally ripe sweet fruit flavors give this wine a candied character. It's full-bodied and feels a little warm on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soft notes of straw and honeycomb grace the orange and red apple fruit tones. The mouthfeel is round and a touch flat on the midpalate, finishing with a bitter almond flavor. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Jammy jumbled foxy aromas set up a blocky flat palate. Greasy flavors of buttered-up berry fruits finish without much verve. This is good enough, but just barely.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A lightweight and easygoing white, this offers soft aromas and flavors of green apple, melon rind and citrus, all framed by bright acidity. The finish is short, but mouthwatering. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of buttered noodles and honey fail to hold up in the glass. This sweet Macabeo feels a bit watery, with no complexity to the palate structure. Flavors of honey and vanilla are slightly bitter.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This medium-sweet rosé is a familiar style of local Portuguese wine. Fruity with raspberry flavor, it gives a slight a prickle on the tongue and has lively acidity. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soft, light and fruity, this wine is ready for a warm day. Apple flavors and clean acidity balance its soft sweetness, making it ready to drink now. Intriguingly, its label resembles that of a much more familiar brand of Vinho Verde.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A pure 100% Syrah that's got an elegant sense of restraint. Bright and compelling, the fruit surrounds classically delicious layers of black pepper and charcuterie, soft tannins and a vibrant personality that calls out for pairing with cured meats and sophisticated cheeses.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sourced entirely from the Otis Harlan Vineyard, these vines were planted about 25 years ago. It's a pleasure to see them singled out for this showcase bottling. It's a rich, oily, nutty, buttery style to be sure, but also dense with ripe apple, pear and peach fruit. The acidity buoys it up throughout a strong, long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Daou brothers' considerable and continual investments is evidence that their wines will matter for years, ensuring a wise investment today. This 70% Cabernet Franc and 30% Merlot offers aromas of blueberry and cedar. Once sipped, the tannins grab with strength before dissipating smoothly. It's a seamless combo of spice, fruit, wood and herbs, but will evolve through at least 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Though the alcohol is on the high side, this vineyard ripens the fruit well enough to sustain varietal character without the veil of heavy new oak. Here it's 50% neutral, 50% new, yielding rich strawberry andcherry flavors with a stiff, mineral streak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This estate wine is seriously structured, with tones of dried herbs alongside richer elements of dense tannins and ripe black fruits. A bright acid backbone maintains a fresh and lively character. It might be best to lay down this selection for further integration.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an aromatic wine containing 8% Viognier, with perfumed notes of flowers and orange peel along with wet gravel, plum and smoked meat. The blue fruit flavors are intense and pure, backed by a squeeze of chalky tannins. Best after 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The grape's stereotypical green nose gets a whole new interpretation, with aromas of sunburned hay, bags of desiccated grass and wild oregano. The herbaceous characters carry the palate, but it's smooth with thyme and chile verde flavors, and a lingering bit of citrus tartness and tannic grip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The rich, fruity core of this 100% Alfrocheiro wine is given polish and weight from time spend in a barrel. The fruit at the heart is dense, showing hints of dark chocolate and spice flavors, supported by structured tannins. This wine is ready to be consumed now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A smoky oak fire meets cooked meats and plum sauce on the nose of this wine, which retains great balance even at 16% alcohol. The mouthfeel is luxurious, complementing the cherry, red currant, licorice and black pepper flavors, wrapped around orange peel bitterness and well-integrated oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plush and dusty, this splendid Merlot offers unusual depth and texture, even for Washington versions of the much-maligned grape. Along with black cherry fruit come highlights of herb and olive, spicy oak and rich earth. The density and detail carry through a long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In 1978, Zaca Mesa became the first winery to plant Syrah in Santa Barbara County, and Winemaker Eric Mohseni keeps pushing the quality. This offers notes of blueberry cobbler, rocks and fresh-turned soil, followed by blue fruit flavors, dark chocolate, leather and slight asphalt.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is intense, full in the mouth and rich. The warm, concentrated character brings out both ripe fruits and minerality. The result is a textured wine, tangy and citrus-driven, that also has broad yellow fruits along with the final acidity. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Impressively concentrated for a Pinot Blanc, it offers intense spice as well as crisp apple flavors. It's bright, with good acidity as well as a rich and rounded aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Not overly sweet, this offers a spicy character on top of a touch of honey and fresh lemon flavors. It's surprisingly and attractively delicate for a Gewurztraminer, and ready to drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Berry aromas are a touch dusty and floral on the nose, with hints of earth and cedar. On the palate, this wine is bright and balanced, with fresh acidity. Rich berry, cassis and spice flavors finish agile and long. Drink through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A classic Napa Valley Chardonnay, this is smooth, rich, balanced and well composed. Flowery aromas of honeysuckle open the way for lemon curd and ripe apple to compete with a depth of crème brûlée character that provides plenty of complexity, with additional accents of honey and spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Kian Tavakoli is the winemaker for this small-production Cabernet Sauvignon with some Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. A brambly, full-bodied wine, it's concentrated in black fruit with a spicy streak of clove.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bold and effusive in flavor, this full-bodied red gives ripe, concentrated, focused fruit flavors that recall boysenberry and blackberry. Tannins create that grippy, dry sensation that tames big slabs of meat. An attractive take on a traditional Spanish grape variety; drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a warm vintage, this blend is ripe yet still balanced, with aromas of prune, blackberry, tree bark and leather. The palate is saturated and broad, boasting flavors of dark, baked, black fruit accented by pepper and chocolate on the finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Still tight and young, this tastes like a keeper that will improve with time. Aged in all new American barrels, it shows aromas of coriander, cumin and smoke, with flavors like black cherry and black pepper. It balances well between firm tannins, good acidity and full flavors, and everything sails through the finish. Best after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Merlot and Syrah join Tinta Roriz in this impressive wine. A fermentation in open lagars as well as time in oak give this blend richness and a deliciously juicy. Ripe and full bodied, it is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fully creamy and generous in crème brûlée and lemon curd, this dances in acidity and is balanced, the texture silky smooth. Highlights center on fresh-cut Anjou pear, a slice of which would go well with the wine, accompanied by Stilton.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from young vines, this is the second wine of Suduiraut. It has young, honeyed character, with a ripe, opulent texture that lays bitter orange fruits over drier noble rot flavors. It is so delicious now, but will be better from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A sharp brine character gets warmer boosts from underlying pear, nectarine and buttered sourdough aromas. Flavors are light and bright at first, with sandy clay, vanilla cookie and custard strudel emerging on the midpalate and a line of acidity down through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Distinct and delicious aromas of crème brûlée with a strawberry glaze pick up some licorice and dark spice when digging deeper. The cranberry fruit's tartness, tannins, and acidity make for a mouth-rinsing wine. Serve with hearty pasta or rich meats.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Similar in style and aging potential to the winery's 2009, and blended with amounts of Malbec and Petit Verdot, this Cabernet Sauvignon from mighty Howell Mountain is rich in spicy blackberry and clove, the tannins soft and juicy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a smooth and generous wine. It is rich, full-bodied and packed with dark plum flavor, but it's the ripe, velvet character that is so appealing. It's almost ready to drink, although the firm tannins and minerality at the end suggest it will be better from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A solid wine for the price, this begins with honeydew and lime aromas. Flavors start with a spicy cinnamon apple before diving into buttered squash, melon and fresh lime, with a dash of salt.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the eastern vineyards of the Douro, in Douro Superior, this estate wine is heavily structured while showing rich fruit and impressive tannins. The texture is strongly mineral, complex and hinting at the concentration from fruit grown in this hot, dry climate. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Perfumed and off dry, this rich wine has spice, structure and a floral character. It is so young with its white fruits, hint of lychee and lime-juice acidity. The wine needs to age to reveal its potential. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The new American oak barrel fermentation and aging steals the show on this wine. Notes of vanilla and woodspice overpower the variety's melon and apple aromas and flavors. There are some good things going on but it's hard to get at them.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% varietal wine offers generous aromatic notes of guava and pink grapefruit. Flavors are lighter in style with the concentration a bit wanting but it finishes well.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This rich, thick, concentrated wine offers big aromas, a velvety, tannic texture and ripe fruit flavors reminiscent of dried plums and blackberries. Full bodied, it shows a lot of oak influence in the strong vanilla and maple syrup aromas, as well as in the flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This multi-vintage blend of Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre and Petit Sirah offers notes of black and white pepper, sea salt, herbs and coffee. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied with a pillowy-soft texture and a spice-filled finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with a pretty floral fragrance of acacia, Spanish broom and chamomile. The palate doles out white peach and tangerine zest alongside fresh acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Straightforward oak and roasted pear aromas great the nose on this wine from one of the region's central and historic vineyards. Flavors are a little flat at first, but then apple flesh and pear skin bitterness emerge, with citrusy acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Berry and plum aromas are spicy and saucy, with secondary notes of tomato and oregano. Snappy on the palate, this live-wire Malbec is a bit aggressive and acidic. Toasty oak and mint flavors accent fresh red-berry fruit prior to an energetic yet woody finish that's raw feeling but fair.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hailing from 1970s plantings, this wine is directly appealing with aromas of corn silk, candy corn, caramel and spice. The palate is sleek in style with plump peach flavors. Try it with crab.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas suggest mature black berry, savory herb and a balsamic note. The palate displays baked plum, black pepper and anisette alongside bracing tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This robust wine delivers aromas of spiced plum, stewed prune, vanilla and chocolate that carry through to the ripe, monolithic palate. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Underbrush, tobacco and spiced plum aromas lead the nose. On the straightforward palate, notes of anise and clove add depth to the black cherry core. It's easy drinking, with lithe tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas suggest toast, mocha, vanilla, dark-skinned fruit and a whiff of burnt matches. The oak-driven spices carry over to the palate along with a licorice note but not much fruit richness. Astringent tannins provide the backbone.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This robust wine features aromas of stewed plum, damp hay and anisette. These carry over to the warm palate, along with dried fruit flavors and the heat of evident alcohol that throws it off balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of pressed powder, blue flower and a whiff of plum waft from the glass. The palate offers dried red berry, sage and mint but not much fruit richness. Bracing, drying tannins leave an astringent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This lightly aromatic wine offers notes of pear, peach and spice. It's straight down the fairway with appealing stone fruit flavors and a lightly creamy feel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of bath oil and exotic fruits like lychee and mango come in front of a short, simple palate that's fresh. Lychee and mango flavors finish in tropical style, with a mild soapy note. The wine is varietally correct and well done.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made with 58% Malbec and 42% Syrah, this wine offers alluring aromas of thyme, dried herbs, raspberry and white pepper. It's elegant in style, supple in feel, providing a lot of easy-drinking pleasure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 41% Chardonnay, 26% Marsanne, 18% Roussanne and 15% Viognier shows notes of grilled sweet corn on the cob and Golden Delicious apple. It's broad in feel but seems to only have one trick to show.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is well-balanced and ripe, with plenty of room for both the attractive black fruits and the firm tannic structure. Wood aging shows, although it will integrate well. The wine is fruity, likely to be ready to drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Leesy aromas of pear and melon are friendly and fresh. This Verdejo is lean, citric and drawn on the palate, with lemon, white pineapple and green apple flavors. A tangy, tight, juicy, acidic palate ensures that this ends with crispness and snap.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The film director's sparkling ode to his director daughter delivers aromas of apple blossoms, pear cider and chalk. An apparent sweetness on the palate is cut with a pithy grip, the apple-juice base leveled with ample lime elements.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of ripe red cherries, licorice and vanilla extract emerge from this wine by the longtime estate across from the township of Santa Ynez. Blackberry and blueberry fruits power the palate, but there's a black dirt earthiness and some meatiness too. Tannins are still quite strong.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 50% Viognier, 19% Chardonnay, 19% Sauvignon Blanc and 12% Pinot Gris offers notes of pear and flowers. It's broad and creamy in feel with stone fruit flavors on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Softly layered red and black berries belie this wine's concentration and force, which is substantial, a backing of powerful leathery tannins at its core. On the nose, there's black peppercorn and an herbal element.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This emphasizes freshness and a light touch, rather than the assertive flavors that this varietal can produce. It smells like rose petals, has a soft texture, rose petal and pear flavors, and delivers a light spritzy feeling on the tongue.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A kitchen-sink blend of nine different varieties with Merlot (40%) and Syrah (25%) taking the lead, this wine brings an assortment of herbs, blue fruit and woodspice along with light volatile notes. It's full bodied and sweet with abundant cherry flavors backed by grainy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "This biodynamically farmed wine comes from Steep Creek Ranch next to the winery facility and Nelson Vineyard on the shores of the Columbia River.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Faint aromas on this 100% varietal wine suggest star fruit and wet stone. It's broad and fleshy in feel, but with light concentration to the Meyer lemon flavors. Pair with beurre-blanc sauced seafood.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crisp lemon, fennel and Bosc pear come into play in this medium-bodied Chardonnay, accented by a taste of fig. Taking on depth and breadth as it develops in the glass and on the palate, the wine finishes long and lean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a rich, maturing wine that is full of toasty, yeasty flavors that are finely integrated with the orange zest and apple flavors. It is just right to drink now, at a midway point between youth and maturity but it will age for several more years. Drink until 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With mint and black fruit aromas, this is a ripe, fruity wood-aged wine. Power and complexity come from the structure and the dark black fruits. Hints of licorice accent the strong tannins and fruit. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ayala specializes in dry Champagnes and this is their extreme example. It has the right amount of bottle age to soften the intense acidity and bring in some toastiness and fruit. It can be drunk now, but a few more months in bottle would make it even better.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from organically farmed grapes, this hearty blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo opens with earthy aromas of violets, iris, mature black fruit and leather. The juicy, ripe palate delivers fleshy black cherry, truffle, tobacco, black pepper and mint alongside solid tannins. It has a meaty, rustic note but it's delicious. Alberello Imports, Ionia Atlantic Imports.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a bone-dry, tannic, acidic and tightly wound Cabernet, with a solid core of blackberry aromas and flavors. Stylistically, it plants its flag squarely in favor of elegance, it just needs a little more time to fully integrate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "What this 100% Merlot lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in the sheer power of its fruit. It's rich and spicy in black cherry, milk chocolate, red licorice and oak, after being aged for 20 months in 100% new French barrels. With thick but refined tannins, it's drinkable now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The vineyard is in the Santa Maria Valley, and has been source for many years of great Pinots for multiple wineries lucky enough to obtain its fruit. The wines always show a similar profile of tannins, brisk acidity, a certain full-bodiedness and plenty of crushed brown spices. In this cool '11 vintage, the wine is particularly tart in cranberries and raspberries. Decant for a few hours before drinking.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The winery's top cuvée is notable for its perfume of rose petals with a subtle whiff of body talc. Balanced and feminine, this soft and graceful wine glides across the palate with flavor highlights of cherries and plums. Drink now while it's at its best.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Technically a Zin blend labeled as Old Vine Wine, Serious is velvety in texture with supple tannins and a complex taste of blueberry compote and cinnamon spice. With a brightness on the finish, it'll age and be interesting with food like venison or other game.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dryness, acidity and minerality mark this Chardonnay. It's elegant, with Meyer lemon, lime and new French oak flavors that bring a rich note of buttered toast. The score is lifted by the wine's balance. Drink now–2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Napa-ness of this Pinot makes it so interesting. Grown in a warmer climate, it's dry, soft and somewhat herbal, with red currant, cola, tea, cranberry and mushroom notes. It feels complex in the mouth, without the flash and dazzle of more coastal bottlings, but there's a lot going on. Drink now–2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It takes a certain trust in the ageability of a young Calera Pinot Noir to appreciate it, as evidenced by this bottling. It's dry and tannic, with acid-inflected raspberry jam and oak flavors that show little in the way of complexity. Yet there are earthy, herbal, minerally depths. Granted that the vintage was difficult, this still is a wine to age. Try after 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright and delicious, this starts with aromas of blue flower, red berries, mint and thyme together with a whiff of leather. The juicy palate offers wild cherry and strawberry accented with cinnamon-spice alongside fresh acidity and firm but fine tannins. Drink now through 2016 to capture the fresh, crunchy berry character.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Some bottle age gives a toasty character to the ripe fruit and lively acidity, adding extra complexity to this rich wine. The citrus and apple acidity are woven together in a tight, mature structure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This firm and structured wine also has full-on ripe, jammy fruits. The combination gives weight, richness and structure. A touch of licorice adds an extra dimension to this fruity, firm wine. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In this complex wine, surface fruitiness doesn't mask the firm layers of tannins that give shape and density. It's full of black plum flavors that show a juicy side to what is also a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A mix of ripe black fruits and dense tannins characterize this young wine. Its structure is surrounded by rich fruits, smoothly textured and generous. Acidity gives the wine a fresh touch in its aftertaste. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Attractive floral aromas of Spanish broom come together with whiffs of pear and mineral. The round but refined palate delivers ripe golden apple, mineral, peach and almond alongside bright acidity. Enjoy now for crisp flavors or hold until 2016 for added complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Juicy flavors of white peach, green apple, pear and exotic fruit team with hints of mineral and white almond. The creamy palate is energized by crisp, quenching acidity that leaves a clean finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% Cabernet deserves its reserve status. Compared to the regular 2011, it's richer, with a smoothly tannic mouthfeel framing blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors. It will hold in the bottle until 2018, but there's no reason not to pop the cork now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a powerfully wood-aged wine, rich and smoothly textured. Full of ripe yellow fruits with a hint of lemon and full-bodied, it is still developing. A touch of minerality and a steely edge add interest and further complexity. It needs to age, so wait until 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a rich, fruity and juicy wine. Great swathes of blackberry combine with acidity and a solid core of tannins. Full of power, with a dense texture, this already delicious wine has some medium-term aging potential. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark in color and deeply flavored, as the name suggests, this blend has evocative blackberry, currant, grilled meat, black pepper and oak flavors. It's also tannic, suggesting cellaring until 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A full-bodied wine, it shows strong vanilla flavor from oak aging and a rich, tropical feel. Lime and other citrus fruits give a crisp edge to this rounded wine that has concentration and final fruitiness. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from Syrah and Grenache, this shows rich, fruity flavors of raspberries, cherries, figs and mocha, but perhaps the best thing is the acidity. It's clean, bright, savory and easy to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The acidity is like a double squeeze of lime juice. It gets the tastebuds whistling, which allowss the intense lemon, lime and mango flavors to spread across the mouth and sink deep into the palate. This zesty wine needs rich fare. Ahi tuna tartare is perfect.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Delicately perfumed with notes of lemon, tart stone fruit and white florals, this off-dry Riesling builds in intensity and ripeness on the palate. It's lushly textured, with flavors of fleshy peach and apricot that are brightened by lemon-lime acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lushly textured and expansive on the palate, this dry Riesling melds flavors of waxy lemon skins with notes of rich honey and saffron. The acidity is sunny and bright, highlighting hints of tangerine and lime on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Refreshing aromas of tangerine and lime are laced with petrol on this steely kabinett. Waves of ripe peach and nectarine flavor add delicate sweetness on the palate, accented by savory notes of dried herb and tea leaves. Lemon-lime acidity leads the long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Enticing aromas of blackberry, bramble and wet leaves meld on the nose of this elegant, nuanced Spätburgunder. It's concentrated and juicy, with black cherry flavor, but invigorated by a stream of laser-like acidity that carries through the finish. It ends with a pretty violet accent.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of Key lime skins and lemon bar cookies hide a slight but typical petrol note on this wine from the San Diego County-based producer. It's slightly sour on the citrusy palate, with balanced acidity and a chalky grip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Petal pink in the glass, this wine was specifically grown to be a rosé by winemaker David Galzignato. The nose is pretty with bubble gum, strawberry, raspberry and a bit of lime peel, and the palate offers flavors of ruby-red grapefruit and lemon juice, with bright acidity throughout.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Delicious fruit aromas and flavors define this medium bodied and very smooth blend that is 50% Graciano grapes. Aromas convey floral notes, strawberries and oranges, while the flavors bring more strawberries and cherries. The texture is not light but the wine is still extremely easy to sip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Central Coast's pioneering sparkling house offers a quite-pink bubbly with aromas of lemonade, yeast, white rocks and ruby-red grapefruit flesh. The palate shows sour strawberry and lime zest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a hilltop location near the ocean-influenced town of Freestone, this wine is silky in plum and dark cherry, a hint of mushroomed earth doing its best to come out. Robust on the palate, juicy berry fruit satisfies, finishing thick and rich.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A tremendous value, this white is light and floral, soft in honeyed stone fruit and pineapple. A nice minerality buoys the proceedings, a medium-body taking on new strength midway through before letting the wine finish crisp and clean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Red currant, vanilla, toasted oak, coffee and chocolate aromas lead the nose and follow through to the dense, full-bodied palate. It's one-dimensional but muscular, with ample, velvety tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of underbrush, blue flowers, cooking spice and black plum unfold in the glass. A blend of 50% Sangiovese and 50% Malvasia Nera, the palate reveals dried black cherry, black pepper and anise alongside firm, polished tannins. Drink through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, this sleek wine opens with aromas of red currant, bell pepper and herbs. On the juicy palate, notes of white pepper and clove add interest to crushed strawberry and cassis. Tangy acidity and polished tannins provide the framework.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A complex blend of five grapes, this is a textured and fruity wine that is impressively fresh and crisp. Apples, strong citrus and apricots are all present in this tight, mineral wine. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with damp, rubbery plum aromas. The palate is spunky and offers live-wire acidity, with cherry, raspberry, toast and pepper flavors balancing it out. Speckled black pepper comes on the dry finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Beautifully purple-pink in color, this blend of 46% Mourvèdre, 41% Grenache and 13% Counoise shows smashed plums and watermelon extract on the nose. The acidity hits the palate first as does a grippy white rock minerality, with pomegranate fruits showing rather ripely.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of vanilla, prune and nutmeg lead the nose on this robust Merlot. The dense, monolithic palate offers raisin, leather and licorice alongside the heat of evident alcohol and drying tannins. It's shy on freshness and fruit richness so drink sooner rather than later.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Round and fruity, this is big, forward and loaded with ripe stone fruit, melon and a finishing lick of citrus. Fresh and lively, it's ready for immediate enjoyment.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While the wine has some concentration from the old vines, its general effect is of a soft, open and generous texture that is full and rounded. There is some spice, a touch of toast and full-bodied blackberry and currant flavors. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Concentrated aromas of plum and black currant come with a leathery, earthy accent. Dense, jammy and ripe in feel, this features blackberry, baked plum and chocolate flavors. A licorice note and controlled heat rise up on a powerful finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bruised apricot, lemonade and citrus rind-laden marzipan notes hit the nose on this wine, which is showing just a touch of nutty, honeyed oxidization. The macadamia nut element arises on the palate too, alongside intriguingly peaty flavors reminiscent of Scotch, with almond liqueur on the outro. It presents decent acidity throughout.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a dark and concentrated wine, solid with dark plum skin tannins and a dense structure. A fresher side brings in spice and a tense texture of both freshness and acidity. It should age a couple of years more, so drink from 2017. The estate, about 31 miles from Toulouse along the Tarn river, has a well-recorded history of family ownership over many centuries and is now run by the Faramond family.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With its 50% Sémillon, this ripe wine has the potential to be rich. It has a perfumed, fruity character at this stage, emphasizing flowery fruits along with citrus. As it develops, it will fill out comfortably. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This rich, full-bodied wine is packed with ripe, dense blackberry and plum flavors. With firm tannins in the background, it is always going to be dark and solid. Produced on a single vineyard by the local cooperative, it could still age and will be best from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made entirely from the native grape Ciliegiolo, this offers aromas of violet, allspice and wild red berry. The bright palate doles out wild cherry, crushed raspberry and a hint of clove alongside silky tannins and fresh acidity. It's easygoing and made to be enjoyed young.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Herbal berry aromas come with plastic tones of latex and rubber band. This shows a gritty palate of hard tannins, with peppery, green-leaning, herbal flavors of black currant and black plum. A clampy, heavy finish gives this blend a lumbersome lasting impression.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of brambly plum and raspberry set up a palate with ripe flavors of black cherry and nutmeg. A baking-spice character carries onto the finish, which turns more soft and candied as it wraps up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made entirely with Merlot, this densely extracted wine opens with aromas of toasted oak, black currants and vanilla. The tightly packed palate delivers dried blackberries, tobacco, espresso and licorice alongside raspy wood tannins that leave an astringent finish. It lacks the fruit richness to stand up to the heavy oak influence.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah, this opens with aromas of black currant, pencil shavings, toast and a whiff of pine. Notes of mocha, graphite and anise add depth to the black cherry core alongside chewy but astringent tannins that leave a drying finish. Drink 2016–2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Black pepper, anise, boysenberry and a bit of juniper combine for a slightly funky, somewhat reductive nose on this blend of 46% Grenache, 23% Petite Sirah, 23% Syrah, 6% Carignane and 2% Mourvèdre. There's an ample amount of blackberry jam and chopped Italian herbs on the palate, with an asphalt character in the midpalate and a somewhat tart finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy aromas of a leather, scratchy plum and a dusty country road lead to a tight feeling, rubbery palate, with flavors of herbs, baked plum and cassis. This is more fruity and ripe than leafy and spicy—overall, it's perfectly enjoyable.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This super-smooth but hearty red blend made from Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre smells smoky, meaty and oaky. It tastes savory and a bit peppery before a good dose of ripe, plummy flavor joins in. It feels full-bodied, and almost soft in texture because of light tannins, but has enough acidity to keep an appetizing balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Refreshing and full of vitality, this Pinot Gris offsets zesty white grapefruit flavor with a sheen of fresh herb and floral notes. It's a dry, elegant wine, with broad appeal and a youthful vigor that should last through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Easy berry and plum aromas come across clean and pure. This has a staunch mouthfeel with rubbery, pinching tannins. Earthy, ripe berry and plum flavors turn even riper on the back palate and finish, which lingers in a solid state.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Licorice and blackberry scents float off the surface of this estate wine. Once sipped, a thinner juiciness takes hold, with boysenberry and cracked pepper leading the way.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fruity and lightly structured, this is a wine for drinking now. It has great juicy fruitiness, soft tannins and an immediately drinkable character, great for barbecues. The wine is named after the Fado Portugal's national music, songs  by seamen longing for home.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Elegant and compact, it offers appealing flavors that call to mind a cherry popsickle—fruity, with palate-cleansing freshness. The wine does a gentle fade, perhaps more quickly than you'd wish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Firmly tannic and dense, this dry wine is dedicated to the winemakers at Vidigal, the authors in the name of the wine. It has berry fruits under its dark texture, promising more fruit in the next several years. There is a show of wood aging as well as acidity at the end.  Screwcap.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Balanced toward the bold side, it's full-bodied and shows aromas of ripe grapes and sage, accompanied by flavors of cherry and plum. Layers of fine tannin give it grip without bitterness. Tasty cherry and baking spice flavors linger on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Boysenberry, cracked peppercorn and caramel frame the nose of this rich red. Although not particularly complex, lush flavors of berry juice and espresso on the palate prove rather tasty and enjoyable.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This has aromas of Bartlett pear and black Mission figs. In the mouth, there are flavors of pear, lemon and fresh picked apricots.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Black cherry and vanilla aromas lead this young Merlot. There are big flavors of red plum and cooked black fruits in the midpalate, with balanced acidity on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Round and soft, it offers apples, citrus and gooseberries enveloped in a full-bodied texture. An edge of steely background suggests it's a wine for some aging, so wait until 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While the aromas scream herbaceous, the palate is more subdued and rounded. That gives space for the citrus to mingle with green apple skin and white peach flavors. It's very fruity and ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 73% Petite Sirah with 17% Zinfandel, this is a black, inky wine, as to be expected, from Spring Mountain's longstanding York Creek Vineyard. Dusty, earthy and mouthfilling, it is out and out savory. Tastes of black pepper and gamy oak lead to a lingering finish marked by more peppery spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hanzell took on a new barrel regime with the 2011 vintage, opening the door to several different coopers to taste over time. Additionally in 2011, the Pinot grapes came from both the Sessions and de Brye vineyards. The wine is marked by a bouquet of baked strawberry and cherry, the layers interwoven in oak and dust.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made with organically grown grapes, it features a levity of citrus at its heart, a celebration of crisp grapefruit and lime. Dry and midweight, it has texture and a pleasant, long-lasting finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Racy, zesty aromas of honey and squeezed orange form the nose of this still-tight wine, a blend of 62% Grenache Blanc and 38% Rousanne from a vineyard at the mouth of the Arroyo Seco appellation. The crisp palate offers pear and apple cider flavors with a finish of honeydew melon. A perfect pairing for halibut and shellfish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crisp, dry and fresh, this is a lively and fruity wine. It's lightly textured, tangy and clean as a whistle. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "As pale as any Provence rosé, this fresh and fragrant wine is delicious. It's crisp in apple and red berry fruits, light and fresh at the end. The aftertaste is as bright as the rest of the wine. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Just off-dry, this fruity and creamy wine has a touch of honey to go on top of the melon and baked apple flavors. Great acidity makes the wine refreshing and brings out the bright fruitiness. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A concentrated wine, it's packed with both dark fruits and tannins. A dense structure contrasts with the fresher black currant fruitiness. Ripe and full-bodied, the wine needs to age. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Thirst-quenching, lean and tangy, it would make a good match with shucked oysters. It shows lemon and green apple aromas, plus fresh and crisp citrus flavors. Medium in body, the texture is pleasantly lean while the finish is refreshing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pine and other green-leaning aromas blend with lychee and exotic soapy scents to lay the path for a round palate with tropical flavors of lychee, melon and star anise. The finish is full, citrusy and generous.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a burly amount of black fruit and black tea in this estate wine, concentrated and coiled in a tight tannic structure. The fruit tends toward ripe black cherry and even blackberry, the texture is soft and the finish delightfully marked by a touch of chocolate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Exotic and exuberant on the nose, this packs scents of peppercorn, crystalized ginger, flower and white peach cobbler. Medium in weight, the midpalate feels fleshy and fit, with balanced acids that drive the concentrated finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose on this earthy wine offers up game, dark berry, plum and a hint of barnyard. The palate is still somewhat closed but reveals crushed red cherry, toast and espresso alongside drying tannins. Drink after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy, ripe, slightly flat aromas of black fruits define the nose on this dense Toro. Soft, mellow, quiet flavors of blackberry and raisin finish rich, loamy and with a note of prune. Drink this ripe, fairly sweet-tasting wine now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Oak, density and medicinal berry aromas are the three most prominent characteristics on the nose of this carbonic macerated Tempranillo. In the mouth, it's full and a bit grabby. Flavors of smoky oak and hickory vie with black-fruit tastes, while the finish is firm and dry, with residual woodiness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Floral, stony red-fruit aromas are the right set up for a tight, almost citric feeling palate. Flavors of cherry and red plum are narrow and quick-hitting, while the finish is bright, juicy and runs on acidity. This demands food; it's raw by itself.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This modern Rioja opens with sweet, jammy, raisiny aromas and spice. The palate is cumbersome, with tomatoey acidity providing spine. Baked dark-fruit flavors show a leathery, spicy side, while the finish is full, grabby and tannic, with notes of prune and rubber. 70% Tempranillo and 30% Graciano.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Minty, scratchy aromas of cherry and berry air out well. This feels chewy yet fresh in the mouth, with plum and cherry flavors matched by good overall intensity and balance. A controlled finish tastes dusty and loamy; drink through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromatic layers of golden apple and pear, beeswax and toasty brioche lead to an ample, concentrated palate, which comes threaded with glowing acids.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This structured rosé has a firm character, with tannins as well as fruit. It's crisp, while also full-bodied, full of ripe red fruits. A steely edge adds to the structure, making this an excellent partner for food.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Brilliant, pure fruit flavors light up this full-bodied but easy-to-drink wine. Cherry, strawberry and something deeper like black currant dance through the aromas and coat the tongue with their richness. The texture is smooth and plush due to fine tannins and mild acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark shades of bramble and smoked nuts lend a shadowy mystique to this unusual Schwartzriesling, otherwise known as Pinot Meunier. Full bodied yet elegant, the palate boasts tart blackberry and raspberry flavors framed in finely grained tannins. A rare chance to experience this grape as a single varietal wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Composed berry, spice, herb and oak aromas are complete and inviting. In the mouth, this is ripe and dense, with chewy tannins. Blackberry, mixed herb and dark chocolate flavors are integrated, while this settles nicely on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crisp and young, this wine, from 50-year-old vines, is tangy and strongly mineral in texture. It is full of fresh fruit that reflects the of organic and biodynamic farming. The green fruits will fill out as it ages. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light herb aromas and vivid apple flavors make this medium-bodied wine delicious, while the tangy, nervy texture keeps the mouth tingling. It has great balance, concentration and length on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark in color, this bold, full-bodied wine is succulent and rich in blackberry and black cherry, with a dusting of cranberry and grilled mushroom. There's a balance of acid and tannin that provides substance and structure, with length on the finish.\n",

      "This big and dry wine is a nice change of pace. The wine looks dark, smells deep and tastes full bodied and firm textured. It doesn't have the overripe or semisweet character of many Zins, but instead is rather tannic and even mildly astringent like strong tea, and has lip smacking cranberry and raspberry flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Quite buttery and nutty on the nose, this wine shows Marcona almonds, seared pineapple, crème brûlée and vanilla custard. Those elements meet with smart amounts of acid and texture on each creamy, buttery, pineapple-laced sip, which then finishes on marshmallow flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Oceanic aromas of grass, scallion, baby garlic and lime reflect cool-coast origins. A slick, juicy mouthfeel is minerally, while this offers flavors of nettle, lime, passion fruit and green onion. A long, stony finish leans towards green flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh cracked peppercorn, dense black and purple fruit and a cedar tone carry through the nose of this lavish yet nuanced bottling from a South Coast winery that practices extended aging before release. The elderberry fruit is hung on a strong tannic structure, bolstered by woody cigar box, incense, juniper and espresso flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Faded yellowish pink in color, this bottling by vintner Richard Sanford and winemaker Nick de Luca shows baking soda, squeezed lemon, sour raspberry and a touch of maraschino cherry on the nose. The palate offers lighter strokes of nectarine and chalky clay notes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From vines more than 90-years-old, this is a refreshingly restrained and elegant wine, earthy in grilled mushroom and cherry-berry juiciness, braced in firm acidity. Cocoa and nutmeg provide compelling seasonings that linger on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The debut release for this producer is a bright garnet shade. Exhuberant and broad, the palate is bursting with cranberry, blue plum and Bing cherry flavors. Drink over the next year or two, while it is at its freshest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Inviting aromas of baked blueberries are leveled by crushed asphalt and dried herbs on the refined nose of this bottling. Stewed strawberry and red plum flavors are elegantly cut by more crushed stone, dried spearmint and a touch of sweet tobacco, all held together by grippy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A bit lighter in color than other Rhône blends, certainly due to the 40% Counoise (and bolstered by 36% Mourvèdre and 24% Grenache), this offers a punchy red-currant, orange-rind and chaparral-scrub nose. Fresh cracked black pepper, cranberry-orange-plum juice and a rich earthy tone show on the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Steel and stones are brightened by tones of lemon and grapefruit in this dry-style wine. It's medium bodied but texturally quite rich, lending a satisfying sensation of volume that adds impact to the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a former Kosta Browne winemaker comes this very dark Syrah, which shows still-wound-up aromas of elderberry, black coffee, white pepper and a touch of game. There are rich soy and beef notes once sipped, packaged by dense tannins and zesty acidity, with more elderberry, beef char and crushed slate emerging with time. Still young.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The closed nose leads onto a compact palate that mixed red cherry notes with sandalwood oak spice. This is elegant and evolves beautifully in the glass. It will sing with earthy mushroom dishes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Young vines, planted in 2007, give a fresh, fruity wine with attractive citrus and zingy orange flavors. It is ripe and deliciously perfumed with a touch of minerality and saltiness. Drink from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "What jumps out immediately is a bright spicy scent. The forward fruit is a zesty mix of cranberry, guava and citrus, and the flavors just punch up the palate in a most delicious way. Drink this over the next couple of years while it retains its freshness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In this wine, red berries and currants burst out of the glass. These are balanced with apple and citrus acidity to give a wine that is all about delicious fruit and refreshing acidity. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The most reserved of this winery's Grenache studies, this bottling shows baked red cherry, red currant, cola and slate on the nose. An iron-based minerality shows on the earthy palate, which also offers chipped slate, cranberry and tart cherry elements. It's a tad light but still intriguingly textured.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Damaged by hail in 2013, the vineyards yielded low quantities. The grapes harvested produced a wine with crisp red fruits and bright berry acidity. The fresh, tight aftertaste suggests the wine will age. Drink from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From Old Wente clones grown on the famous vineyard, this full-bodied, textured wine shows ripe elements of golden honey, Gravenstein apple and toasted vanilla oak. Along the way, it flirts nicely with pear and marzipan, finishing in balanced minerality.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plump, waxy aromas of baked apple and lanolin are complex and proprietary to Garnacha Blanca. This feels full and creamy, with moderate but present acidity. Slightly bitter, peppery stone-fruit flavors fold in a note of papaya and vanilla. A steady finish is healthy and balanced.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine comes from one of the best vineyard sites in Savigny-lès-Beaune, on the slope closest to Beaune. It is a smooth, perfumed and ripe wine that has a balanced structure under the bright red-cherry flavor. Still bursting with young fruit, the wine will age, so wait to drink until 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "When a rosé pushes past 14% alcohol, that's an indication of a pretty potent wine. Here's a fine example, showcasing ripe strawberry and peach fruit, with excellent concentration and mouth-filling flavors. Using all free-run juice, this is fresh and full-bodied.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lemon freshness encounters some honeyed richness. There's a hint of pleasant bitterness of honeycomb on the flavor, while the palate is streamlined with zesty lemon freshness. These create an intriguing and successful counterpoint on the dry, slender but expressive body.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Gentle spice and redcurrant notes promise a subtle wine. The palate does not disappoint and sings with translucent, light-footed elegance. This is all about charm and ease, about chiffon rather than velvet. Crisp freshness brightens and lightens everything. It's a mere whiff of a wine but a delicious one.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Summer fruit and fresh ripeness dominate: think red apple, yellow plum and breezy lemon freshness. This wine is really uplifting, light, fresh and friendly: it paints a picture of summer aperos under open skies. Drink soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% Furmint offers scents reminiscent of yellow peach, vanilla and caramelized pineapple upside-down cake. In the mouth, there are bright flavors of green apple and gooseberry.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A dense, leathery, richly stylized wine from a great vineyard site, this offers thick layers of dark chocolate, blueberry and plum. Integrated in terms of oak and tannin, it delivers concentration and power, capped off on the finish in a shot of cigar.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fronds of leafy herb and violet perfume align in this vibrantly composed Cabernet Franc. It's equal parts earthy and fruity, showcasing ripe black cherry and plum flavors etched by savory shades of mineral and soil. Fine, penetrating tannins squarely frame the finish of this red.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a small, 15-acre property, this wine is ripe, rich and full of yellow fruits along with crisp apples, with a tight texture that needs to develop. It is crisply structured, zesty and mineral in character. Give this juicy, delicious wine until 2017 before drinking.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This outgoing and full-bodied wine has a lot going for it. Fruity, enticing aromas lead to fully ripe flavors that suggest plums and fresh strawberries, with a suave and supple texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Oregon-based producer has sourced Petaluma Gap grapes to craft a light, clear and somewhat smoky and full-bodied expression of the variety. It's dense and rich in black cherry, currant and cola-vanilla.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an estate-grown, co-fermented field blend of Zin with Cabernet Franc, Alicante Bouschet, Petite Sirah, Grand Noir de Calmette, Peloursin, Lenoir, Merlot and Mourvèdre made in a small amount. Powerful tannin and leather are the stars, along with flavors of cigar, black pepper, cherry and orange.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of wild berry, leather, sunbaked earth, star anise and a balsamic note of menthol lift out of the glass. The robust, powerful palate offers fleshy blackberry, wild cherry, cinnamon, nutmeg and tobacco alongside chewy tannins. Despite the juicy fruit, there's a warmth of alcohol on the finish but it doesn't dominate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made with 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc, this boasts aromas of black currant, mature plum, black pepper and clove. The ripe palate delivers fleshy black cherry, blackberry, licorice and Mediterranean brush accompanied by firm, fine-grained tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deep ruby red to the eye, this red wine has a nose of cherry, pomegranate and lemon peel. It comes on bright, offering flavors of cherry, peach, eucalyptus, rose petal and pencil lead. Velvety tannins coat the palate into a finish that is a luscious mélange of cherry and orange zest with a touch of mint.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is a field blend of 80% Zinfandel, with 10% Petite Sirah, 6% Alicante Bouschet and 4% other mixed black grapes. High-toned in plum and dark cherry, it's bright while also being plush and juicy. This is a small-production offering from a fairly cool area for the grape.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Saperavi and 5% Rara Neagra has aromas of red raspberry, violet candy and black cherry. There are flavors of cherry vanilla and pomegranate with soft tannins and an elegant finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine has a compelling earthy funkiness that's both varietal and fun, a tangle of red fruit, sassafras and cardamom that's light and bright. It makes a great companion to food.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Forest floor, mature berry, scorched soil and a whiff of new leather lead the nose. The palate shows dried black cherry, mocha, cinnamon and clove alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. A licorice note closes the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Berry, herb and baking spice aromas lead the nose. The palate brings fleshy plum, cherry and coffee flavors that linger on the finish. This wine provides great easy-drinking appeal.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a robust, full-bodied and sultry wine, one within the producer's single-vineyard series, from a well-known and respected site. Oak and candied black cherry sit atop an abundance of cola spice and earthy truffle, promising more to come as it opens in the glass.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big and chewy, this opens with aromas that recall leather, truffle, scorched earth and ripe plum. The brawny palate offers dried black cherry, raspberry jam, licorice and a gamy note alongside a tannic backbone. The heat of evident alcohol marks the finish. Loaded with rustic charm, it has more power than complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The cherry, herb and barrel spice aromas are quite brooding at present. The fruit flavors are all about elegance of expression, showing pleasing complexities and plenty of hang time on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Coffee, toast, nut, forest floor and fleshy plum aromas waft out of the glass. The big, round palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry jam, licorice and chopped herb alongside ripe, loosely knit tannins. It's straightforward for a Brunello but it has a juicy, immediate appeal. Drink now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The fact that this variety is still in the ground in the county says something; the fact that's it's still in the confines of Pagani Ranch says even more. In this ode to generations gone by, the grower and winemaker find common ground in showcasing a big-bodied, black-purple expression of fig, plum and grippy leather that lands softly on the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Bulgarian Pinot Noir offers the nose black and red cherries and dried violets. It is well balanced in the mouth with soft, rounded tannins and flavors of dark cherry, cranberry and dried Mediterranean herbs.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There are not many châteaux in Sancerre—this is one of only four. Surrounding the building, vines produce this fresh, crisp and tightly fruity wine that has a strong minerality along with a lively, tangy character. The wine is attractive already, although it will be better from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tire rubber, herb and locked-up barrel spice notes are followed by bountiful yet elegant black fruit flavors that show a spot on sense of balance along with exquisite length. There's no hiding the warm vintage it comes from but it shows the year well.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with aromas that suggest leafy underbrush, scorched earth, star anise, steeped plum and a whiff game.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a parcel of 25-year-old vines, this is a concentrated, firm wine that needs to age. It has good potential with its tight, steely character and smoky edge. The fruitiness comes from the organic and biodynamic grapes that give richness as well as a final fresh, crisp aftertaste. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The name of the wine (land of the angels) is inspired by the fact that monks first planted the slope. More prosaically, it is a delightful wine, fresh and crisp with tight acidity that promises to soften to bring out the citrus and ripe pear flavors. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe and creamy, this has rich pear and apple fruits lightly cut by more lemon flavors. The wine is fruity, textured with minerality and still young. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Produced from organic and biodynamic grapes, this wine is tangy and crisp, a perfect model for white Sancerre. With its bright apple and ripe pear flavors, it's bursting with fruit and lifted by acidity that has just the right intensity. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with aromas of forest floor, truffle, ripe berry, leather, crushed blue flower and a whiff of herb. The medium-bodied, concentrated palate offers juicy Marasca cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and nutmeg alongside integrated tannins that give the finish grip. Drink 2018–2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ivy leaf and ripe, green pear notes make up this wine's enticing nose. The palate brims with juicy pear and citrus, feeling concentrated, lively and moreish. Dry and streamlined with citrus, it also layers pear and peach fruit before finishing with lip-smacking citrus zest.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A hearty swirl in the glass wakes up this wine's aroma, showing lemon balm, cress and green pear. Those fresh flavors also play on the lithe palate, where yeasty savoriness is enhanced by lemony spritz. It's totally zippy and refreshing, with far more concentration than is at first apparent, proving it needs time to breathe.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the reserve-level Pinot Gris, comprised of lots from five different vineyards. Juicy, succulent and quite tart fruit flavors emphasize fresh apples and pears, lightly dusted with cinnamon spice. The concentration and lingering finish prove it worthy of its reserve status.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plump and succulent, the 2015 Hunting Hill displays attractive notes of hickory smoke and white peach, underscored by the suggestion of citrus custard. Like all of the 2015 Chardonnays from Kumeu River, it shows great length and intensity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Toasty blackberry and prune are the key aromas on this plush Cabernet. A generous mouthfeel includes choppy tannins that will mellow in due time. Dark flavors of cassis and blackberry include spice and chocolate notes, while this finishes with ripe flavors of blackberry touched up by chocolaty oak. Drink this calm, slightly flabby Cab through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earth, leather and strong but quality oak notes accent berry-fruit aromas. Cheek-sucking tannins make for a rugged mouthfeel. Spicy, peppery berry flavors are fully oaked and toasty, while this tastes dry and minty on the finish. Grilled meat and/or a few years on its side is what this needs. Drink through 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Consistently one of New Zealand's top Chardonnay producers, Neudorf flies the standard for Nelson, almost next door to better-known Marlborough.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bottling from McMurray Vineyard at Rancho Sisquoc packs all of the beloved Syrah characteristics: ripe plum, blackberry and blueberry fruit, a vanilla-laced oaky frame and underlying hints of lavender and pepper. The palate offers herb and pepper touches, underscoring its black fruit and caramel flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lovely, herb-tinged fragrance—as fresh as aloe vera and as aromatic as fig leaf—jumps out of the glass in this wine. The palate contributes yeasty earthiness and concentration, all highlighted by freshness and verve. The finish is clean and zesty.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This elegantly structured wine is a wonderful expression of Sauvignon's serious side, offering delicate yellow stone fruit, wildflower and toasted nut scents. On the polished, full-bodied palate, a hint of nectarine backs up creamy yellow peach fruit while fresh acidity lends balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Named after César the sculptor and not Caesar the Roman emperor, the wine has a strongly herbal character that seems to come from the superripe fruit as well as the landscape around Monte Sainte-Victoire. It is certainly rich, although the acidity balances out the spice and pepper character. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Audibert family estate, close to beautiful Aix-en-Provence, is now run organically. The wine, rich and with delicious ripe fruits, is full in the mouth, packed with red-berry flavors that are cut with red currants and lemon zest. It is a very fine wine, ready now.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a rich wine, packed with red-berry fruits. Despite its density and ripe fruits, it has a fine streak of acidity that keeps it lively and crisp.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromatic and lushly scented with rhubarb, strawberry, cola, root beer and cocoa powder, this is immediately accessible, and yet structured to age if you can keep your hands off of it. Streaks of beet root sneak in around raspberry and cherry fruit, with firm tannins and highlights of toast, coffee, caramel and dark chocolate. This is a very fine cuvée that seems to gain focus as it rolls through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A warm but fresh green and yellow pear peel scent on the nose gains even more currency on the palate of this wine. The midpalate exudes a savory, yeasty, textural element that provides structure and interest, yet the finish is very fresh.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Waves of purple floral fragrance meld with soy, blackberry and roast lamb on the nose of this complex and compelling bottling.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Foley's Chardonnays always manage to be both extremely tense yet flavorful—a combination that will please many palates.

Drink through 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is one of the vintage's knockout rosés, thanks in part to the Grenache and Gamay grapes that make up the blend. It's pale pink in color, with supple lime pith, strawberry, chalk and melon aromas. The palate is tense with structure, its bubblegum and lemon peel flavors riding a wave of acidity that persists long into the finish.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a small 19-acre estate, this is a fruity and juicy blend of Braucol and the still rare Prunelard. It has a tannic stalky edge that suggests the wine can still develop. This serious concentrated wine was made in egg-shaped cement tanks and is from organic grapes. Drink from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dusty toffee and dried stone-fruit aromas are pure and inviting. This is ultra crisp and fresh, with ripping acidity. Flavors of toffee, salted peanuts and sharp-leaning dry white fruits finish racy and with precision. This is a classic complex amontillado purchased from the cellar of Manuel Cuevas Jurado.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soft and supple on the palate, this impressive wine is lightly spiced with dust and clove, its tannins rounded and in support of lingering cassis and red cherry flavors. Mocha and tobacco lend additional depth and complexity as it unfolds, punctuated by juicy acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This block selection hews closer to more conventional Oregon Pinots than the rest of the winery's portfolio, with powerful focused black-cherry fruit at its heart. It was fermented with native yeast and spent 17 months in barrel, 12% new. Those flavors come through in deft touches of graham cracker and cocoa powder, underscored with a wet-cement minerality.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine's nose is still closed, but its palate presents velvety, cinnamon- and vanilla-tinged black cherry fruit. The tannic structure acts like a velvet grip around its pleasantly fruit-dense core. That richness is countered by freshness in a package that's sure to give lots of pleasure through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark in color and offering opulent aromas of crème brûlée and marshmallow, this vineyard-designate is marked by its wealth of orange blossom aromas, an inviting, floral entry.

      "Estate-grown Viognier makes up the majority of this blend, followed by 25% Roussanne and 22% Marsanne. Delicate, the aromas lean floral and tart, a combination of peaches and honey that build into an oaky, powerful finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sanguine in red plum, clove and dark chocolate, this bottle-aged, full-bodied wine is impressive and still quite ripe and robust. The tannins are prominent and supported by a girth of oak, with a dense, concentrated finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Woodland berry, pressed violet, dark cooking spice, truffle and new leather aromas unfold on this brawny wine. The full-bodied palate doles out ripe black cherry, ground pepper, licorice and tobacco accompanied by velvety tannins. It closes on notes of menthol and the warmth of alcohol. Drink 2018–2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of toasted oak, mocha and a whiff of coconut oak lead the nose while the firm palate offers dark cherry, espresso, dried sage and a hint of anise. The tightly wound tannins still pack youthful sharpness and need a few more years to soften up. Drink after 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Complexity and varietal character come through in this concentrated, well-balanced and smoothly polished wine. It is full bodied and lightly tannic, but so oozing with flavors that it's still easy to sip. The array of black plum, light sage, and black olive flavors is accented with very light oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine has a bouquet of cassis, violet and black pepper. Well-integrated flavors of cassis, strawberry preserves, anise, fennel bulb and lavender are set amid silky tannins that feel as if they may go on forever but are surpassed at the finish when fruit flavors pull out all the stops.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This spent 18 months in 50% new French oak, which underscores its pretty berry/cherry fruit with a vein of dark chocolate. Dr Pepper and spicy herbs decorate a solid midpalate that flows into a lengthy finish with confectionary highlights.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full bodied, buttery and spicy in aroma and oaky in flavor, this wine has a big, bold personality from the first whiff through the lingering finish. Complexity and body are its strong suits rather than fruitiness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a producer always to consider for Rhône-styled wines. A mix of strawberry pie and Nilla wafer, this 100% varietal wine is robust and full bodied. Structured with plenty of tangy acidity, it'll stand up to cellaring or a decant. Drink now through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Succulent in red cherry and cassis, this wine has a surprising level of depth and grip. It finds its way with integrated tannins, soft layers of caramelized oak and a brightness of fruit and acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A twist of clove, fig and chocolate figure into this powerful, concentrated wine, with baked plum, tobacco and maple taking on secondary roles. It's full bodied and thick, so pair appropriately. It finishes in black pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A red-violet color, this wine has a bouquet of blackberry, lilac and pencil lead with a whiff of iodine. A network of velvety tannins and a vein of bold acidity are equally weighted, wrapped around flavors of blackberry, blueberry, black pepper, rose petal and Mediterranean herbs, with bright fruit persisting into the pleasing finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deep garnet to the eye, this wine has a nose of strawberry and tart cherry with a hint of resin. Flavors of cherry, pomegranate, eucalyptus, anise and a soft touch of leather are suspended in a web of well-moderated tannins. Expect a lasting sense of coolness with a burst of brightness on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Inky violet-red in the glass, this wine has a fruit-forward nose of black cherry and strawberry. There is a good balance of acidity and tannins amidst flavors of black cherry, raspberry, caramel and orange zest. The perception of light spice remains on the tongue after the gentle finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This low-alcohol rosé spent five months in neutral oak, yielding additional complexity and an appealing creaminess to the finish. Strawberry and cherry flavors are accompanied by lighter hints of peaches and sweet spices. It's a thoroughly modern, delicious rosé.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of toast, grilled herb and red berry lead the nose along with a whiff of fresh mint. The palate is still primary; offering bright Morello cherry, white pepper, anise, clove and hint of tobacco while a dried sage note closes the finish. Bracing tannins and brisk acidity provide the framework. Drink after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is definitely a light vintage for this vineyard-designate. It deftly mixes cranberry and raspberry fruit with hints of wet stone. Proportionate, drying tannins line the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Long extended veins of bramble and dried herb lend depth to this intensely concentrated Spätburgunder. Youthful and primary, the palate bursts of rich black cherry and berry, but soft tannins and brisk acidity invigorate the finish. It's luscious and forward yet refined. Drink now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raspberry, plum and cherry aromas are light, pure and fully inviting, with nothing off-putting. This tastes bright and balanced, with cherry and berry flavors that are impossible not to like. A dash of oaky cocoa blends with leftover red fruit flavors on a nice finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Winemaker Nick Goldschmidt does wonders with this consistent vineyard source, coaxing out mocha-chocolate, black cherry and blackberry, never overpowering an earthy back note of tobacco. Medium-bodied and soft, it finishes in a swirl of smoke and is juicy and enjoyable now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Enticing notes of brioche and baker's yeast waft from this brut-style Riesling Sekt. It's perfumed and floral, yet elegantly composed, drenching the palate in waves of fresh grapefruit and lime. Piercing and pristine, it finishes with crystalline precision.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A few swirls of the glass release engaging aromas of baking spice, red berry, rose and a whiff of tar. The linear, elegantly structured palate boasts bright wild cherry, white pepper, cinnamon and a mineral note alongside vibrant acidity and assertive but refined tannins. It's still rather austere but should blossom into a beauty after a few more years in the cellar. Enjoy after 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Compact aromas of red berries get a boost from oak-based coconut, cedar and graphite notes. This is a blend of three Malbec vineyards of varying elevations; it's bursting with acidity, while high-toned plum and currant flavors are a touch salty. A lively, fiery finish is fueled by latent acidity. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of toast, espresso, ripe berry and menthol lead the nose. The round, savory palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry, clove, chopped herb and game alongside chewy tannins. A coffee note closes the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lifted honeysuckle and jasmine perfume abound throughout this textbook Mosel Kabinett. Sun-kissed apricots and peaches burst on the palate, yet maintain a graphite edge of minerality and acidity. It's a crystalline fruity wine that's irresistible now for its youthful exuberance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Red berry, dried rose, truffle and a hint of scorched earth aromas come together on this solid, no-frills Barolo. The straightforward palate delivers wild cherry, ripe strawberry and a hint of cake spice alongside firm, ripe tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2016–2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wild berries, from elderberry to salmonberry to mountain strawberries, are in play in this wine. The underpinning scents suggest earth and wet cement, while in the finish a strong flavor of breakfast tea lingers. This is an interesting addition to the Sineann lineup.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From what is now an estate property, once known as the Nugent Vineyard, Winside is brawny and brooding in wild strawberry compote, dark plum, blackberry and an inviting lushness. High-toned acidity keeps it from becoming overly dense on the palate. Strong tannin on the finish reflects a high-tannin vintage overall.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bright and spicy wine refreshes with palate-cleansing minerality. The crisp, fresh-cut pear and apple fruit carries hints of orange liqueur. Drink this while it's in the bloom of youth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a soft wine that has plenty of red-berry fruits, bright acidity and a light fruity texture. It is dry although the softness gives it an apparent sweetness. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The volatiles are amped up here, providing distraction from the cherry and spice aromas. It's a shame as the palate delivers plenty of plump lightly sweet cherry flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of grapes mainly from the Beaujolais region, this is soft, with cherry fruit and bright acidity. It has an attractive, easy character that makes it ready to drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a perfumed, ripe wine. It has black fruit, soft tannins, a light character that emphasizes bright fruit and a juicy aftertaste. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Horsey plum and pie cherry aromas include a whiff of latex gloves and Band-Aid. This feels rather raw and acidic, with bite. Salty sharp red-fruit flavors finish herbal, with tartaric shear.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This light-bodied wine from a cool vintage wine shows jammy raspberry with hints of leather on the nose. It may have already peaked.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Produced in eastern Alentejo, near Spain, this light and soft wine is easy and drinkable. It has a smooth texture, just hinting at lemony acidity. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The volatiles are quite amped on this wine. It makes it a struggle to get at the tart black cherry flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A light, almost thin wine, this hints at green fruit, white stone fruits and mineral texture. Drink now for its fruitiness and crisp aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an attractive, warm, rounded wine. Yellow fruit flavors are cut with white fruit and acidity. It has a smooth, creamy texture that gives it extra richness. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This soft, light wine boasts crisp fruit and acidity. It has a touch of bitterness, with almond and tight citrus flavors, and is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "High-acid red wine is not for everyone, but this one—dry, stalky and light—is a genuine example of a wine that has always had a following in northern Portugal, great for pairing with fresh sardines. Think that way, and it's more than just a curiosity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wiry herbal aromas of blueberry and currant lead to an acidic citrusy palate that's choppy and a bit rough. Quick-hitting plum and currant flavors are herbal before hollowing out on a zesty, tannic finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a soft rosé with ripe strawberry fruits and light acidity. A Bordeaux-style blend of the two Cabernets and a dominance of Merlot has produced a caramel and fruit-flavored wine that is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This soft fruity wine has a candied character. It is light, crisp and ready to drink. Produced from Malbec, it just hints at the tannins natural to the grape, preferring fruitiness and acidity. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This light-colored wine is attractively perfumed but with a grassy edge that suggests the fruit was underripe. Built for the short term, it will be ready from late 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a soft and crisp wine that shows attractive, tangy orange flavor and has plenty of acidity to keep it as fresh as possible. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of Bical and Cercial is toasty and dominated by its wood aging. Wood-derived spice notes cover its crisper green fruits.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a soft, fruity and easy wine. With simple tannins and black currant fruit laced with spice, it's made to be drunk now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cherry and cassis notes provide a touch of brighness on the nose and palate of this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Cabernet Franc, 26% Petit Verdot and 6% Malbec, but its plum-raisin backdrop and dullness on the finish suggest it might be going downhill.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rudimentary aromas of lemon-lime and apple set up a flat palate. This tastes of dried apricots before turning decidedly bitter. On the finish, flavors of dried white fruits are modest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Flat and fruitless up front, this smells a bit like a haystack. Plump on the palate, with a sense of grape skins to the mouthfeel, this tastes yeasty, mildly bitter and of nonspecific white fruits.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sour fruit, funky root beer, dried salami and asphalt aromas show on the nose of this rustic bottling. Dried fruit and espresso flavors mark the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This soft, robustly ripe wine shows a raisin-like prune character, tasting somewhat chalky on the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a thin, unfussy wine that imparts bell pepper and asparagus in a sea of green flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "High in ripeness and intensity, this vineyard designate overpowers with astringency as it plows through a wall of blackberry jam and chocolate flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This sweet sparkling rosé is clean and crisp. It has attractive strawberry fruit, soft texture and a light mousse. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An unusual earthy, herbal character dominates the mild fruitiness and marzipan character of this medium-bodied, slightly sweet wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sweet and fruity, this canned wine feels soft and syrupy, with sugary pear as the primary flavor on the palate. It's a basic white wine in a convenient package.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raisiny aromas lack freshness and lift. Following that lead, this Cabernet feels stewy and heavy, with questionable balance. Herbal flavors of stewed plum and tomato finish chunky and choppy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the winery's most pebbly five-acre section of vineyard atop Diamond Mountain, this is dark black-purple in color. The tannins are soft but powerful, eager to age through 2025–2027, while the fruit lies on the currant and plum side of things, with a bit of cedar lurking through.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "All four of Dâo's indigenous red grapes—Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Jaen and Alfrocheiro—are in this blend. It is rich and fruity wine, showing a lightly perfumed character against ripe black fruit tones. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A Cabernet-based blend, with Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot, this offers pleasing aromatic complexity, with notes of coffee, dark fruit and vanilla, accented by floral overtones. The palate is full bodied, with abundant coffee and cherry flavors backed by firm tannins. The fruit and oak seem to tussle a bit at present; try after 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich and varietally expressive on the nose, this Cabernet Sauvignon is softened by the addition of 15% Merlot, the two combining in layers of ripe plum and tobacco. With mouthwatering acidity and firm tannins, it offers a complete package of enjoyable, approachable Cabernet.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An evenly dispersed nose of sage bark, cherry compote and lightly toasted cedar introduces this bottling by Fred Brander, a Santa Ynez Valley winemaking pioneer now actively trying to create a new Los Olivos District appellation. The flavors are balanced between cherry fruit and oak, with smooth tannins throughout.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With rich melon aromas, ripe apple flavors and a soothing, almost soft texture, this wants some rich, sophisticated cooking to go with it, like sautéed fish with a classic French sauce. Subtle acidity keeps the notes of almond and apple lingering on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From vines now a dozen years old, this unusual Walla Walla AVA Sauvignon Blanc is a brilliant straw color—aromatic with light scents of ripe grain and tangy fruits, and fills the mouth with delicious flavors of melon, white peach, lemon verbena and a dash of pepper. Complex and engaging, it finishes dry but leaves an impression of slight sweetness. Drink it slightly chilled.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hugely ripe, this is a dense and potentially intense wine. Its high alcohol brings out a disturbing pepper character that spoils the purity of the rich fruits and mineral texture. It shows the heat of the volcanic soil of Ragen de Thann Grand Cru in its rich fruits and ripe structure. It does need aging, so drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This has a brighter yellow color than most of its peers, more body, riper fruit flavors and—unusual for this variety in America—probably some oak influence. Rather full bodied, but well-balanced and very smooth, it combines peach and pear flavors with a hefty mouthfeel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is ripe and smooth, with a generous creamy texture. Spice and apple combine to give a tangy edge that will soften and integrate as the wine ages. It's full of potential. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crafted from Wente clone grapes from Charles Ranch, this label is the passion project of longtime wine industry player Tony Lombardi, who manages the much larger Kosta Browne brand. Barrel-fermented in neutral oak this wine offers heady Tahitian vanilla and lemon curd around green apple skin and lemon. The palate is both creamy and crisp, the finish reasonably powerful.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an impressive, big and broad wine. It's full of dusty tannins and ripe, rich black fruits. Solid with spice from the wood aging, it is concentrated and holds fine aging potential. The Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend gives the firm structure that will allow it to develop well. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soft, subdued, savory and subtle, Old Kraft dates back originally to the 1860s, much of its plantings traceable to the 1890s. Zinfandel and Petite Sirah populate the gorgeous pocket of a site, a stone's throw from Spottswoode. Blackberries and raspberries figure prominently, alongside intrigues of cinnamon and clove, a forested note not far behind.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Grapefruit rind jumps out of the glass in this vivid, balanced and refreshing white that also carries a complex mix of lime, more grapefruit and the tiniest suggestion of fresh-cut grass. A creaminess to the texture rounds things out and soothes the edges.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Richness (of both flavor and texture) marks this deeply colored, full-bodied Syrah. Aromas of ripe blackberry and licorice coupled with flavors of clove and blackberry jam make it luscious yet not overly big. It has the firm tannins and good balance for aging through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This full-bodied wine offers classic Nebbiolo aromas of underbrush, black cherry, leather and a whiff of baking spices. It's still young, delivering raspberry, clove, cinnamon and grilled herb framed by tightly woven tannins. Give this time to unwind. Drink after 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A Castillon ridge mix of 95% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, this perfumed wine has new wood and mint flavors that balance with the black fruits and tannins. It's ripe, with fresh acidity as well as structure. There's just 8,500 bottles from 7.5 acres. This will age well, so drink from 2017. Owner Nicolas Thienpont purchased the vineyard in 2011.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Attractively perfumed, this Verdier family wine comes from Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon vineyards in their first certified French organic vintage. The wine is a smooth and polished. New wood flavors show strongly, after 16 months in barrel, alongside the ripe tannins and black plum fruits. It has rich potential and a strong presence. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From 7.5 acres of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a rich wine, very perfumed and with layers of ripe fruit. It is lightly structured, full of red berries with a firm tannic character in the background. Under winemaker Olivier Dauga, the wine needs to age but has all the fruit potential there. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is fruity and juicy with good acidity and fresh berry fruits. The 90% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon blend has the right amount of tannic character, showing structure that brings out ripe red fruits and indicates good potential. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine has serious tannins and firm fruit that give an austere character at this stage. But it will develop and round out into a rich wine with ripe black fruits, always with a solid tannic structure. Owner Juliette Bécot manages the technical side here with consultant Jean-Philippe Fort from the Michel Rolland lab, and manages marketing at classed-growth Château Beauséjour-Bécot in nearby Saint-Émilion.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big and juicy, this is an attractive blend of 70% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Malbec with a promising future. It has ripe berry fruits, touches of spice and ginger. The tannins are firm, dusty and dry while allowing plenty of room for the fruit. It will develop well; drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A wine club selection, this pure Malbec is fragrant and streaked with well-defined layers of blackberry, dark chocolate and earth. There's a pleasing whiff of sandalwood and baking spice that carries through to the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It's listed on the back label as off dry, and in fact has 11 g/L of residual sugar, but it boasts a certain roundness and fruit persistence. Though labeled Columbia Valley, in fact it's 100% estate (Red Mountain) fruit, and old vine—30+ years—to boot. It's well-crafted, with a mix of citrus—flesh and rind—plenty of backing acidity and a thoroughly refreshing finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A vibrantly aromatic, dazzling wine with abundant notes of lychee and rose petal. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied and drinks dry with a lot of hang time on the pronounced, floral finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Zesty in black pepper and luscious in blackberry, blueberry and raspberry, the grapes are from 90-plus-year-old hillside vines. Complex and structured, it offers a balanced point of view and plenty of intrigue, simultaneously fresh and brooding.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From 100% estate-grown Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grown in the heart of the Stags Leap District, this earthy red offers black tea and coffee aromas and flavors, suggestions of wild sage and black pepper enveloping the nose. Medium to full-bodied, elegant and well-composed, the tannins are soft and structured, the wine able to age, drinking well now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 60% Syrah, 27% Merlot and a handful of other varieties added to the mix, this aromatically pops, with complex notes of plum, blueberry, smoke, chocolate and floral accents. It's silky smooth in feel, with abundant chocolaty flavors that help it go down far too easy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a rich and ripe wine, densely textured with firm tannins that provide a solid structure. Made from selected fruit grown in the north of the Tejo region, the blend of 60% Aragonez, 25% Syrah, 15% Merlot is a textured wood-aged wine that has red and black berry fruits followed by balanced acidity. It is ready to drink, but will improve after 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Herbal and earthy up front, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Carmenère and Malbec brings notes of green tobacco and black olive to the front along with toasty oak. The palate is tight and crisp, with choppy tannins. Flavors of toasty oak and berry fruit compote finish resiny, with juicy, zesty acidity. Drink through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The inaugural vintage of this wine offers notes of caramel, herbs and raspberry. The flavors are full, chocolaty and sweet, backed by dry tannins.\n",

      "Lightly aromatic, this suggests potpourri and raspberries. It's elegant, clean and fresh in feel, with tart acidity and a pleasing sense of purity to the apple and raspberry flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Briny aromas suggest pickled white fruits and even some sauerkraut. In the mouth, this is tight for a fairly sizable wine. Dry peach and bitter melon flavors settle on citrus pith, while the finish is long and leesy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Leesy on the nose like the name implies, this Godello smells creamy, with notes of apple and melon. The palate shows moderate citric acidity but nothing scouring, while flavors of ripe apple, orange and powdered sugar finish leesy and peachy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lemony-vanilla crème brûlée rises to the fore in this medium-bodied Chardonnay. Medium to high in acidity, it retains a crisp freshness throughout its layers of fruit, finishing clean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hot, stalky aromas of red chili flake and weedy raspberry lead to a lean, tomatoey palate with flavors of tomato, dried berry, vanilla and especially dill weed. A saucy, woody finish confirms that this is now mostly oak and acid; drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pinched, rubbery and earthy-smelling, but with ample berry, plum and char aromas, this young, oak-aged RDD is full and well balanced. Blackberry, cassis and oak flavors dance well together, while the finish introduces hickory and herbal notes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Exuberant, ripe fruit flavor energizes this medium-bodied yet smooth and fresh-textured wine. Shadings of spicy oak add complexity.  The freshness and fruit will make a great pairing with spiced meats.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raspberry and plum aromas are woody and narrow in scope. This Cabernet is medium in body but also a bit sticky and resiny. Candied blackberry and black cherry flavors are slightly medicinal, while the finish is oaky, with a lactic flavor and a touch of heat.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This brightly aromatic wine suggests lime leaf, clover, wet stone and orange blossom. It drinks off dry (24 g/L residual sugar) with a broad feel and a narrowing finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cardamom and vanilla lend warmth and spice to fresh black cherry and blueberry flavors in this sprightly wine. It's rich and ripe in fruit concentration, but delicately textured with a brisk, spry finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromatically distinctive, this suggests dry chocolate, orange peel and tart cherries. Flavors are on the lighter side of medium bodied, soft in feel with abundant umami flavors and tart acids.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Herbal and foresty up front, this Bordeaux blend smells of fig, caramel and berry fruits. Big, tannic and chunky on the palate, this has toasty, chocolaty, burnt flavors and a blackened finish. This offers a lot of power and fruit but it's brusk.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blended from several stellar vineyard sites, including La Cruz and Devoto, this wine presents a brightness of acidity and crisp, red fruit. These are offset by a heartier uptake of oak and tannin that feels out of place compared to many of the producer's single-vineyard offerings. On the finish, expect tart cranberry and pomegranate to peak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot finished off with 5% Cabernet Franc, this cool-vintage wine is light in color. Notes of plum and cranberries come with herb and floral accents. It's light and lively with elegant, pretty fruit flavors backed by mouthwatering acidity with a lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A very subtle aroma leads to a rich feel on the palate, where ripe plum and soft berry flavors emerge. This wine is totally smooth, warm and plush, full bodied but with soft tannins that make it easy to sip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Scents of lemon-cake icing meet the pretty yet not treacly tropical aromatics of white flowers on this barely off-dry wine. The sweetness is noticeable on the palate but far from overdone, with clean flavors of lemon custard, tangerine juice and a Key-lime finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This smells oaky and tastes ripe and pure, like crushed blackberries and raspberries. It feels plush and smooth in the mouth, finishing on the soft side. While medium bodied, it has just a touch of tannin to balance the ripeness and make it appetizing to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Damp earth and forest floor mark this wine, a blend of various clones, the majority of which are Pommard. Red raspberry and cherry compete for attention aromatically and in taste, followed by a spiciness of Christmas clove.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This tastes honest, clean and direct, with a nice mixture of fruity, woody and savory herbal aromas and flavors. It's medium in body and offers just a touch of tannin to add a little grip to the texture. A tasty raspberry note gives it even more personality.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This warm-climate wine is fulsome and hearty in baked Asian pear and candied ginger. A dried-fruit quality stands out on the buxom palate, a buttery taste of dried apricot drizzled in honey and brioche.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This aromatic wine offers notes of jasmine, quinine, flowers and peach. It drinks medium sweet with lightly spritzy stone-fruit flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "One of the many chateaus with vines on the wide valley floor of the Dordogne, this estate has made a lightly extracted wine that has chocolate as well as blackberry stalkiness. There's freshness as well, with fruit acidity that cuts through the mineral texture. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fruity, soft and ripe, this is almost ready to drink. Attractive berry fruits are touched by a smoky character from the wood aging. Balancing Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot equally, the wine has ripe tannins and a gentle, juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This smoky wine has firm tannins and a tough core. The juicy fruit is taking its time to develop, although it will give the wine density and ripe berries in time. The vineyard, created in the early 1980s is now at peak maturity. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is smooth and ripe, with soft tannins that are already so well integrated. The texture is dense, full of blackberry fruits, full in the mouth and with a velvet final texture. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fifty-year-old vines are the backbone to this firm wine. Mint and smoky wood-aging flavors give a dry, dense character. Underneath the Cabernet tannins and black currant fruit are developing well. This is a wine for the medium-term, drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Coming from the warm 2013 vintage, this easy-drinking wine offers notes of sweet corn, pear and peach with light barrel accents. The fruit flavors are elegant with a lightly creamy feel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Chocolate, coconut, plum and coffee aromas lead the nose on this densely concentrated wine. The monolithic palate offers black cherry, chocolate-covered coconut and oak alongside astringent tannins that dry out the mouth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Milk chocolate and pomegranate curiously mix in this mid-weight, lowly oaked nonvintage Cabernet, blended with 18% Merlot and 2% Petite Sirah. New American oak aged most of it, with a bit of French, too, only 25% of the whole new.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the first release from a new, two-acre vineyard devoted to this old-school clone. It's what might be called sculpted, with excellent definition among all the components. Pomegranate and raspberry fruit carry a hint of pine needle, and the finish carries  through with good focus and medium length.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe, heady tropical fruit and citrus aromas extend onto the palate of this dry, yet deeply fruity, concentrated Riesling. It's unabashedly juicy, but textured and mineral on the palate, finishing long and with a streak of high-toned acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crisp in green apple and lemon, this light Chardonnay, only 12.4% in alcohol, will sweep you off your feet with Thai food, seafood or as a before-dinner quaff. From an un-grafted, old Wente clone vineyard found abandoned (thus the name), it has a trace of salinity throughout and a lurking layer of Asian spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intense aromas include crushed tomato vine, elderflowers, hay and tropical fruit. The vibrant palate offers yellow peach, kiwi, honeydew melon and a hint of lemon pastry alongside crisp acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This savory wine opens with a heady fragrance of rose and lychee. The linear, steely palate offers rich tropical fruit and a saline note brightened by energizing mineral sensations. It has nice length and finishes dry. Oliver McCrum, T. Edward Wines.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of exotic fruit, green melon and crushed tomato vine carry over to the palate along with a mineral note. The vibrant acidity gives a linear character and a clean, focused finish. Oliver McCrum, T. Edward Wines.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Some ageable Cabs are lovely to drink on release. Not this one. It's tough in tannins, with a gum-stinging astringency. Below all that are ripe, concentrated blackberry jam and cassis flavors. Blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it's already throwing some sediment, a good sign, which means you won't have to wait 20 years for it to come around. Pop that cork after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This structured Pinot Grigio boasts aromas of yellow spring flowers, exotic fruit, citrus and a hint of Alpine herbs. The juicy, vibrant palate delivers green apple, pear, white peach and citrus allied with fresh acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Merlot is dry, full-bodied and delicious in fruit and oak. Black cherries, currants, mocha, plums, vanilla and fragrant sandalwood all come together to provide a complex drink that's firm in tannins and fancy in the finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's something old-fashioned about this blend of all five classic Bordeaux varieties. Partly it's the tannins, which are brusque, and partly it's the alcohol, which is low. On the other hand, the fruit is ripe in the modern style, brimming with raspberries and cherries, and there's plenty of fancy new French oak. It's a pretty wine to drink now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hints of menthol and bramble meld with rich black-plum and cherry notes in this composed Pinot Noir. It's juicy and concentrated in black fruit flavors, but graced with a spray of delicate floral notes and brisk, revitalizing acidity. Soft, fine tannins square off the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Musky floral, spice and cherry-blossom notes meld in the exuberant bouquet of this aromatic auslese. It's blossomy on the palate as well, and luscious, with sweet peach and yellow cherry flavors. It's unabashedly lavish, but balanced by a streak of citrus acidity and a long, lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ebullient on the nose, with scents of mango, lemongrass and yellow flowers, this off-dry Riesling is intensely tropical in style, but elegant as well, with searing lime acidity that cuts through layers of juicy, ripe fruit and finishes remarkably dry.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine shows ripeness, depth and purity. In the mouth, it is saturated and thick. Flavors of saffron, tomato paste, oregano and stewed berry fruits are pure Kankana. A different breed of Syrah, it reflects San Pedro's pioneering efforts in the Elqui Valley.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Whiffs of freshly pressed apples are accented by pretty peach and honeysuckle notes on this dry, refreshing Riesling. The palate is lean in style, with subtle stone-fruit flavors that feel brisk and vivacious against a backdrop of pineapple acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a savory vein of herbs and smoke that persists from start to finish on this deeply fruity auslese, adding a shade of dimension and complexity. It's zippy in lemony acidity, but silky and sweet, with luscious flavors of preserved peach and tangerine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This powerful Pinot, from one of the three distinct blocks within Black Kite's estate vineyard, offers earthy plum compote and blueberry with a lingering background note of vanilla. Bright, grippy and layered, the finish offers toasty oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Structured and elegant, it delivers aromas of white flowers, stone fruit and almonds. The juicy fruit palate recalls yellow peach, apricot and pineapple while aromatic herbs and white almond add depth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A rich, perfumed and juicy wine, it is full of fruit and also solidly structured. Coming into balance, it still needs some more time. Give this full-bodied, dense wine until 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A dark and brooding wine, it's very much a Malbec that needs to age. Solid tannins, berry fruits and concentrated structure all promise a serious wine that needs time to mature. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This impressive wood-aged wine has weight, rich black and red berry flavors and a smooth, unctuous texture. With its concentration, ripeness, acidity and tannins, it could age through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Given the difficulties of the 2010 vintage, this wine is a success. The tannins are young, thick and astringent, and then the acids kick in. After that initial assault, the palate begins to get more interesting complexities of black currants, blueberries, minerals and oak. The suggestion is ageability, but only limited. Give it until 2016–2017 years and drink with hearty fare.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dense and structured, this is a firm wine from the Santar estate. It is powered by its tannins and partnered with ripe black plum fruits. There is a feeling of tough rocks, a dry core that need some time. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This complex, ripe wine reflects the steely character of Dão whites along with perfumed acidity and rich white fruit flavors. Lime, apples and pears are smoothed by wood aging and given a final burst of freshness. It's ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Gritty aromas of berry fruits, wild herbs and leather are hardly shy. This has a lot of energy and acidity across the palate, while flavors of blackberry, plum and coffee finish ripe, baked and rich, with a slight raisiny note. Enjoy with grilled beef or lamb.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here's a Pinot Grigio for grownups. It opens with aromas of white flowers, Granny Smith apple and a hint of flint. The palate delivers creamy peach, apple and melon alongside a touch of vanilla. It conveys wonderful depth and freshness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A small planting of an unusual “Upright” clone yields this fragrant, smoky, lightly earthy Pinot Noir. Chock full of briary red fruits, it's a tart, lip-smacking wine, drinking well in its youth, but also positioned (via bracing acidity) for further years of bottle age. The young fruit gives a pretty, cherry candy note to the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a tannic, acidic, hard-to-appreciate wine due to the cold conditions of the 2011 vintage. But the wine, which is 100% Cabernet and was aged in 50% new French oak, still is a great success, testimony to skillful viticultural and winemaking practices. With a solid core of black currants, it wants until 2020 in the cellar.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full bodied, this opens with aromas of vanilla, butterscotch, citrus and oak. The palate offers ripe golden apple, pear and lemon pastry, all layered with well-integrated oak. The rich flavors are balanced by fresh acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Despite showing raspy rawness on the nose, this Cab Franc is also aromatic with earth, spice, leather and leafy black fruits. The palate is tannic and slightly reduced, while flavors of baked berry, licorice, hard spices and chocolate finish herbal, peppery and gritty in feel due to residual tannic grab. Drink through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dusty aromas of yellow apple and cream soda are creamier than the palate, which is tangy, lemony and green. This tastes of briny citrus and green apple, while tangerine, lime and green-herb flavors define the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plum and berry aromas are lively and come with a mild scent of animal fur. This blend of four grapes, led by Tempranillo, feels blocky and loosely defined, while flavors of plum, raspberry and a touch of herbal green finish spicy and woody. Will function best as an everyday wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cidery aromas vie with bready notes to give the bouquet complexity. This feels zesty, juicy and citric, with a lean, racy body. Apple cider, green herb, lime and scallion flavors finish with a lasting taste of lime.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of blue flowers, forest floor and red berry lead the nose on this straightforward red. A blend of 80% Sangiovese, with 20% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, the smooth, accessible palate offers red cherries, strawberries and anise alongside bright acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This unoaked, Dijon-clone wine is lively and lush, with tongue-coating fruit. Melon, banana and papaya flavors steer it in a tropical direction, with a lick of mineral and phenolic bite giving further support.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Stripped-back cherry and raspberry flavors take on a jammy character with airing. This is tight, bright and mildly acidic on the palate, with raspberry, red plum and brown sugar flavors. Toast and a molasses-like sweetness carry an otherwise juicy finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soft and earthy, this wine's herbal, funky nature suggests Carneros as much as Sonoma Coast, with black tea and crunchy dried cranberry lurking on the back of the palate. Medium in weight, it eases into a mellow finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here is a well-focused wine with appealing toastiness as soon as it's opened. Fruit flavors are still tight, but unfold into tangy raspberry. It spent 18 months in half new French oak, to good effect.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blackberry, cherry and earthy aromas are backed by a secondary wave of oaky char. This is 80% Garnacha and 20% Carignan with raw clamp to the palate created by grabby tannins and tomatoey acidity. Briny raspberry and plum flavors finish with rubbery tannins and related grab. This is a tough wine but one with lots of life and power. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Closed on the nose at first, this wine reventualy reveals black currant and cassis around wrapped tobacco leaf, the midpalate somewhat dry and puckering in tannin. Concentrated and dense, it finishes in dusty mocha.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a bold, ripe wine that is full of black fruits and generous tannins. It has a rich, warm character that is tempered by acidity and a crisp black currant aftertaste. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine starts off a bit tarry or rubbery, but with airing that dissipates to reveal a dry, savory, complex rosé. It's a blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre that builds in layers of texture from chalky to silky on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Chunky and fleshy, this is loaded with spicy pear and lighter melon and tangerine fruits. Full, forward and fresh, it's delicious and ready to go.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a satisfying, ripe and rich wine. It has big layers of red fruits, attractive spice from partial wood aging and fresh acidity. Still young, it will be even better from early 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from a majority of Cabernet Franc, complemented with a small handful of Merlot, the wine is aged in new French oak half barrels. Tannic and savory in cassis and cranberry, the wine also shows a trace of black tea and tomato leaf. The wine's oak remains extremely pronounced, which suggests some time in cellar, through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pure Négrette produces a smooth, black cherry and red berry-flavored wine. Light hints of wood from aging in big barrels have helped to give the wine a rich and spicy character. This is further enhanced by black-fruit acidity that adds a fresh streak to this warm, ripe wine. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Apple, peach and melon aromas are fresh and easy to like. This has a pure palate, with citric and malic acidity offset by pulpy weight. Peach and apricot flavors finish long, and overall this should maintain its good shape over the next year.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rubbery, somewhat funky aromas shift toward iodine and stewed blackberry. A dense palate houses rubbery tannins that are short on structure. Baked blackberry, plum and cassis flavors finish toasty, herbal, leathery and salty.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A hearty blend of Merlot and Cabernet, this opens with aromas of cedar, vanilla, underbrush and black currant. The warm, one-dimensional palate delivers dried black cherries, raisins, tobacco and anisette alongside velvety tannins. You'll also get the heat of alcohol that dominates the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made entirely from Tempranillo—a rarity in Italy—this opens with aromas of blue flowers, plum and a whiff of leather. The smooth palate delivers dried cherry and prune, accented by ground pepper and oak-driven spices. Bracing but fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide support. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Green bell pepper and cedar aromas lead the nose of this easy-drinking blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The aromas carry over to the fresh palate, along with black currants and black cherries. Supple tannins support the juicy flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This ripe, tannic wine has a good sense of balance between the firm structure and the potential of the rich, full-blown fruit. Blackberry fruit shows strongly, giving a dense wine that will still develop quickly. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mocha toffee and raspberry liqueur provide an alluring entry into this wine, before it evolves into soft layers of blackberry and black currant. Medium to full-bodied, this has thick, dry tannins that stay prominent through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from the native grape Pugnitello, this hearty red opens with aromas of dried Mediterranean herbs, scorched earth, allspice and overripe black fruit. The warm, forward palate doles out baked plum, ripe blackberries, blue flowers, clove and the heat of evident alcohol. Velvety tannins wrap around the palate, but the dominant alcohol throws it off balance and gives it a monolithic character.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Showing a slightly coppery blush hue, this softly aromatic wine has a pleasing muskiness. It's high acid, slightly spritzy, clean and fresh. Though perfectly quaffable, it's not a typical Oregon Pinot Gris.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fruity and forward, with a spritzy mouthfeel, this is like a bowl of cherries, with a cherry candy finish. Highlights of orange and grapefruit come through also. Drink now through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The vineyard was planted in the early 1970s, and this wine shows some old-vine complexity. It's an elegant drink, with a nicely finessed fruit and acid balance. Light and clean flavors suggest watermelon and raspberry with a hint of cherry.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is not as light on the palate as the low alcohol reading might suggest. The raspberry and strawberry fruit carries aromas and flavors of composted earth. It's an interesting wine, and offers good value in a Willamette Valley Pinot.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Scheurebe, a Riesling hybrid common in Germany and Austria, is a rare find stateside, particularly in dry styles. Zesty lime pith and pineapple flavors are brisk and revitalizing in this light-bodied sip. A touch of fresh herbs and white-tea astringency lend nuance to the crisp finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With vines in the northeast of the Gers region, this winery produces impressively ripe red wines. This wood-aged and spicy wine is still young and needs time to integrate the wood with the red berry fruits. It does have weight and potential richness, so give it until 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy aromas of dried herbs, forest floor and freshly felled fennel shrubs emerge form this blend from the now William Foley-owned Firestone brand. Warm cherries and tart acidity make for a nice blend of fruit and complexity on the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A soft and rounded wine, it's ripe, full in the mouth and warm in character. A steely edge merges with the ripe apple and pear flavors to give a wine that's rich and ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very dry, with a firm mineral content, this rosé really needs food. Fresh red currant and raspberry fruitiness are surrounded by tannins and tight acidity. Drink by 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe and smooth, this is a rich, rounded wine that has a warm character, tasting of sunshine. With soft tannins, a touch of caramel from the wood aging and layers of black fruits, it's an attractive wine to drink now, or age until 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Jammy cassis, blackberry and foxy aromas define the nose on this lush, almost ponderous blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Petit Verdot. There's flatness to the palate along with flavors of blackbery, plum and dark, minty oak. A heavy, grabby finish is bold and voluminous.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is rather subdued but after ample time in the glass it reveals aromas of oak, toast, espresso and chocolate that continue on to the palate along with vanilla notes. It lacks the vintage's hallmark intensity. Drying tannins give an astringent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pretty aromas include violet, crushed berries and a balsamic note. But the palate isn't very expressive, offering up raw Morello cherry and espresso notes alongside racy acidity and astringent tannins. Drink after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Old Wente clones drive the richness of this wine, a mix of lemon, oak and fennel, with a touch of spice on the finish. A waft of buttered popcorn invites intrigue aromatically, developing into creaminess on the body. Bacigalupi has a history of famous Chardonnay, having provided grapes for Chateau Montelena's winning Chardonnay in the 1976 Paris Tasting.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a mix of herbal aromas and raisin on this blend of Malbec, Merlot, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah. In the mouth, it's edgy and rubbery, with rock-hard tannins. Flavors of baked black fruits, tobacco and citrus peel finish raw and rubbery. This will need a lot of air and also hearty  food to show its better side.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A penetrating whiff of wintergreen is the first impression of this aromatic young wine. The tightly-wound fruit brings cranberry and tart plum flavors into focus, followed by a lick of dark chocolate running through stiff tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a firmly wood-aged wine, full of spice and burnt toast flavors. They leave little room for the berry fruits at the moment. It is structured, a statement wine with its heavy bottle, and needing time to round out. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a rich, broad-shouldered Pinot Noir, woodsy and oaky with a firm and fierce grip on the palate. It leans more toward earth and smoke than exuberant fruit. Textured in soft undertones of silk, it also offers plenty of fresh herb, a component to take advantage of in pairing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A delicate, almost fragile wine, this opens with tart fruit flavors of strawberry and red plum. There's more than enough acidity, smooth tannins, and a graceful flow to the wine, ending with a light dusting of cocoa.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a rich and jammy wine, packed with black fruits as well as dark tannins. Dark chocolate flavors come from the wood aging which also leaves a burnt taste. These both suggest this potentially fine wine needs to age. Drink from 2016.\n",

      "Even with some hours of breathing time, this remains tight and tannic, with compact flavors of black cherry hard candy. A streak of cola is highlighted with brown spices. The wine loses momentum in the finish, which thins out and quickly fades.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Loaded with scents and flavors of chocolate, mocha and buttered toast, this forward and very pretty wine surrounds a light core of strawberry and cherry fruit. It's polished—even silky—and very tasty, though without the depth and complexity for long-term aging.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of stone fruits and citrus are dusty and nice; so is the mouthfeel, which is fresh but shows texture and body. Watermelon, nectarine and citrus flavors finish slightly bitter but within reason.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Despite being nine years old, this comes across young and jammy, with foxy aromas of wild berries and animal fur. The palate is blocky, heavily extracted and fully ripe in feel. Flavors of prune and blackberry finish with hard tannins. Drink or hold.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Barolo has a somewhat raw quality, delivering sensations of tart red cherry, black pepper, sage, coffee bean and bitter chocolate. The bracing tannins are astringent and overpowering at this stage. Try it after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Stewed tomato, graphite and mushrooms in a brown sauce lead the aromas on this single-vineyard offering from downtown Santa Barbara-based winemaker Ryan Carr. The tomatoes continue on the palate, alongside cran-raisin juice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine has an unusual combination of sweet and sour sensations that include ripe plum, sour cherry, vanilla, dark chocolate, hay, dill, sage and leather. It's still very young with nervous acidity and aggressive tannins that need time to tame.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This rich wine has both open, ripe black fruits and the freshness of the vintage. On top, there is an extra layer of color and exuberance. It includes some Petit Verdot, rare in Saint-Émilion.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is already soft, warm and attractive. With blackberry fruit, ripe tannins and a crisp acidity at the end, it shows a generous nature. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Firm and dry, it's packed with as much tannin as fruit. It has a dark, structured character that's shot through with mint and black currant flavors. The aftertaste is dense and solid. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This super-rich wine is dominated by ripe Merlot that is given structure by leaner Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is ripe, full of black plum flavors and dark tannins. Touches of licorice and wood aging flavors give a bitter edge to this powerful wine. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fruity and attractive now, it features touches of lime, spicy underlay and tight crispness. It's ready to drink, very fresh and fragrant.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "High-toned aromatics precede a light, lean palate, with a jolt of tingling acidity polished around a medium-weight body. There's  a hint of wet stone and spice to the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Minerally, warm aromas are rustic and savory, with berry power lurking in the backdrop. A full, grabby, tannic palate is meaty in feel, while flavors of blackberry, dark spices, cocoa and herbal notes finish flush and tannic, with ample ripeness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose on this estate bottling is sparse at first, with pencil shavings and a speck of boysenberry fruit. It opens more once sipped, delivering a pleasant tartness powered by sour cherry flavors and a tiny bit of clove.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is steely, crisp and mineral. It is brightly lit by acidity and juicy green fruits, plums and limes. Over all the fruitiness, a tight structure gives a cool aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The softest hint of apricot can be discerned on the nose. The palate reinforces this flavor with more soft stone fruit and just a touch of off-dry sweetness. The result is a very expressive, gently but deeply fruited, slender palate that will sing with spicy Asian dishes or soft cheeses. It offers wonderfully lasting flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Delicate yet well-integrated, this emphasizes flavors high in tongue-tickling acidity. Lemon, lime and orange fruit, along with a touch of leather, runs into a finish hinting at wild cherry, cola and molasses. It's subtle, but convincing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very pure notes of cherry and strawberry pervade this wine. They are perfumed with a slight conifer scent that spells freshness and lifted ease. The palate has an unforced, elegant concentration. This is charming and fresh, with convincing depth, purity and a lasting, fresh finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of raw oak, cinnamon, bacon and clove outmuscle fruit on this rough, tannic, scraping 2013. Flavors of toast, chocolate and baking spices push blackberry and black-plum fruit towards an oaky, abrasive finish with rocky tannins and accents of chocolate and cinnamon. Holding this for another couple of years may or may not soften this fierce but tasty RDD.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an amazingly tasty and focused wine that has the most distinctive black pepper character. It's medium-bodied, dark and smoky looking and quite flavorful, backing up the pepper with lively raspberry notes and staying lively from the first sip to the last.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Malbec and 22% Petit Verdot is rich and layered on the nose with black-cherry, blueberry, dark-chocolate and roasted-beef aromas. The palate kicks off with a touch of mint, then offers thick blueberry, coffee syrup and soy flavors. The structure is still quite sticky, and will open with time.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "White blossoms and summer peaches persist from nose to finish here. The palate is lusciously sweet, dripping with ripe, rich apricot and tangerine flavors, but a backdrop of lime acidity makes it refreshing too. Drink now through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Leather, cedar and tobacco figure most prominently here with an additional 12% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend helping matters. The juicy core of blackberry and currant brushes against a rustic, burliness of tannin that finds balance and restraint on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine combines 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Zinfandel and 3% Petit Verdot from the producer's Three Palms Vineyard. Smooth and toasty, it's also structured and vibrantly fruity in black cherry, with delightful hints of clove and black pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A seductive oak aroma and richly layered fruit flavors make this wine a bit of a show stopper. The fine-grained tannins add a velvety mouthfeel, while the full body adds extra viscosity to extend the aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Stridently purple in hue, this bold, richly berried wine deftly blends the spice and smoke of Lemberger with the plush black fruit and bramble of Merlot and Dornfelder. Hints of granite and herb lend elegance but its faint tannins and sunny acidity make it enjoyable now through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Guava and caramelized honey scent this lusciously fruity yet dry Riesling. It's ripe and silken on the palate, but vibrantly structured, finishing on a mouthwatering crush of tangerine flavor. Drink now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is one of the most inky, concentrated, fiercely tannic vintages of Alion to date. Aromas of granite, boysenberry and grilled meat feed into a biting, full-bodied palate that can only benefit from more time. Blackberry, vanilla and chocolate flavors finish with mocha notes and stocky, rugged tannins. This is fierce and unrefined now; drink from 2018 through 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoky, earthy, black pepper aromas make this wine catchy at the first sniff, and then the flavors fill the mouth with similarly spicy, earthy suggestions. It is full-bodied, firm-textured and quite concentrated. Pour this with venison or smoked duck or another game dish if possible.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a beautiful, fresh, relatively light and nicely balanced wine with a gorgeous array of vibrant fruit in both the aromas and the flavors. It pours on red and black cherry and raspberry while backing them up with good, taut acidity and light tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This medium-bodied Shiraz is refreshingly medium-bodied and drinkable, with softly dusty tannins on the finish that don't get in the way of present enjoyment. The aromas are a bit floral, hinting at stone fruit and anise, while the flavors are raspberry and red plum. Drink now–2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intriguing aromas of wilting rose petals, turned earth, wild mint and a lamb-like gamey character entertain the nose on this very special bottling. The palate is quite tart with cranberries, pomegranates and strawberries, with the fruits' bright acidity carrying deep into the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Schloss Vollrad's standard-label Kabinett has a distinctly sheer, almost ephemeral lightness. Juicy white peach and grapefruit flavors shine brightly on the palate, but are edged by angularities of acidity and crushed stone. It finishes long with a lingering kiss of sweetness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From vines that were 79 years old when the fruit was harvested, this is made in a deliberately lean style to encourage cellaring. Notes of lemon, crushed stone and apple skin are taut and dry, with a dusty, tactile sensation on the finish. Drink now, or hold through at least 2020 to allow for more development.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Apple, yellow flower and sea breeze aromas lead the way. The bright, elegant palate displays lemon, lime and walnut alongside vibrant acidity. A mineral vein underscores the savory flavors. Drink now or hold another two or three years for more complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is well poised between structure and fresh red fruits. A dark side of firm tannins gives a dry core to the wine, while the bright red-berry fruit is perfumed and fresh. The two elements are integrating well. Drink from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A perfumed village wine, this is made from four different parcels. The wine offers an attractive touch of tannin and spice to go with the forward red fruits. It should develop relatively quickly, and will be ready to drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose has the rich fruity tones of apple and plum peel. The palate is wonderfully clean and fresh, with a slight phenolic frame which lends both structure and texture. There is slight pepper spice, too, and a whole host of red, ripe apples.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Emblematic of the emerging trend of pushing finished alcohol levels down and aromatics up, this puts the flavor emphasis on subtle complexity. It offers a full range of tart red fruits, along with seams of dried leaf and milk chocolate. It was entirely whole-cluster fermented, and aged 16 months in 15% new oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of toasted oak, nut, acacia flower and orchard fruit come together in the glass. The firm palate offers mature yellow apple, candied nectarine zest, toasted hazelnut and flinty mineral. Bright acidity provides balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Alluring scents of fragrant spring flower, citrus and ripe orchard fruit set the tone. The lively, refined palate doles out lemon zest, Mediterranean herb, juicy nectarine and apple alongside bright acidity. A saline note closes the succulent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Alluring scents of Spanish broom, iris, berry and a hint of dried herb come together on this. The bright palate offers candied cherry, nectarine zest, white pepper and a hint of fennel while a mineral note signals the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright and savory, this opens with enticing aromas of wild berry, fragrant blue flower, rose and a whiff of exotic spice. The silky, easy-drinking palate offers succulent Marasca cherry, black raspberry, white pepper and a hint of clove alongside lithe tannins and fresh acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Subtle aromas of red berry, brimstone and a floral note lead the way. The palate offers juicy red cherry black raspberry, cinnamon and clove while a mineral note signals the close. It's still young but balanced, with fresh acidity and firm, refined tannins. Drink 2018 through 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pressed wild flower, hay, fennel and ripe berry scents mingle together in the glass. The refreshing palate combines crushed strawberry, juicy red cherry, saline and a hint of baking spice alongside bright acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine required considerable aeration before it began opening up. Once there, the airy pretty fruit flavors emerged, a mix of Bing cherries and a dusting of malt powder. It's got a buoyant midpalate and a pleasing streak of orange Creamsicle.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Stunningly good for an entry-level Pinot Noir, this new Tavola gets the sort of care generally reserved for reserves. Native yeast fermentation and almost a year in 20% new French oak is where it starts; then a barrel selection is made and it's bottled unfined and unfiltered. Deep flavors emphasize black fruits, with a dash of pepper highlighting the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a small parcel of 19th-century vines planted on the hill of Saint-Mont, this is a finely structured rich wine. It has dark tannins and dense black fruits that are balanced by acidity. Rich, spicy and full, it still has tannins that will begin to soften shortly. Drink from 2018 until 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich and developed dried pear and apricot notes stream from the nose of this wine, signifying its evolution. The palate is dry but rich with fruit and an emollient sense of vanilla spice. This is structured and bold, holding ample power within its broad shoulders and plenty of length on the finish. Pair with an equally potent dish or cellar and drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Winemaker Bill Brosseau tapped into his family's vineyard to produce this light and delicate wine. Its aromas suggest white flowers, key lime and chalk, while its flavors are high-toned and tight, recalling chilled pear, lime and pomelo pith. A graphite-like minerality adds complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blue fruit, raspberry, violet, dark chocolate, green olive and spice aromas lead to ripe fruit and herb flavors that mix in plenty of smoked-meat notes, heightened a dazzling feel. A lengthy finish caps it off. It's an intriguing wine that keeps you coming back for more.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Delicious blueberry, plum and cinnamon notes are still shy on the nose. The palate also holds them tight with pervading, lively freshness and a very slight spritz. White pepper spice colors the edges, making for an exciting, concentrated but light-footed wine that has rusticity and elegance in equal measure. Lovely now but sure to develop. Drink now–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Produced only in top years, this rich wine is impressive. It has great fruit, ripe strawberries and red currants bringing juicy fruitiness. There is also a more serious mineral texture that comes with tangy acidity. Age this wine for a few more months and drink from the end of 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of Grenache and Cinsault comes from the small cru area of La Londe. Produced from organic grapes, it is pale in color, although rich in texture and with touches of white peach and strawberry. With its pepper and tangy texture it is a style of rosé that could well age. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe plum, forest floor, truffle and dark spice aromas lead the nose. The delicious, enveloping palate doles out fleshy blackberry, juicy black cherry, cinnamon and licorice flavors while an earthy hint of game lends character. Firm, velvety tannins provide polished support. Drink 2018–2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This dazzling, dry and restrained wine was matured in new French oak but with such a light touch that it feels more lean than fat in texture. It has enough fruitiness—crisp apple and lemon flavors—and spice to make it tempting now, though it will improve with age. Best after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Exotic and complex, this medium-bodied, structured wine is awash with aromas, from charcuterie and mixed nut to cedar and pencil. Anchoring it is a dusty tannic profile and a punch of oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The estate blend is a terrific value in this vintage, coming close to equaling the quality of the single-vineyard wines. Grilled pineapple and melon notes feature a strong acid line that drives through into a long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a single-parcel wine from old vines (which date back to the 1970s). Aged in wood, this very fine wine shows sophisticated tannins, complex spice, black-plum fruits and a judicious shot of acidity. It is a fine wine, still young and showing a good potential for aging. Drink from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is tight, toasty and focused upon opening, with highlights of green olive and a core of mixed tree fruits. Excellent concentration, vivid acidity and a suggestion of wet rock contribute to a well-balanced wine with structure and length. The framing here is just right, with 30% new oak adding subtle threads of light wood flavors. Decant or cellar till 2020 before drinking.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pale in color, this ripe wine is beautifully balanced. It does have rich fruit, raspberries and wild strawberries. It also has a fine texture with plenty of acidity as well as a touch of pepper. The wine could age a further few months, so drink at the end of 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plush and elegant dried purple flower, baked black fruit, graphite and char aromas show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is full of flavors that range from rich black currant to lively anise and cedar. Quite tasty and complex all around.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fragrant hints of bergamot and Seville orange play enticingly on the nose of this beguiling wine. The palate amplifies those juicy, tart and lively flavors, sending them dancing into the finish. It's fresh, fruit-driven, dry and utterly moreish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas draw you into the glass, with complex notes of smoked meat, plum, herb, flowers, orange peel and cinnamon. The mouthfeel is swoon-worthy, showing a compelling sense of intensity and balance. The sense of purity is knee buckling.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This dark and meaty blend of 58% Syrah and 42% Grenache shows black currant, charred game and black licorice touches. The palate combines pepper-crusted beef flavors with pretty violet and lilac accents, framed by a tannic structure that's robust but not obstructive.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deep but elegant lilac and rose petal aromas meet loamy soil, river stone and tangy cranberry on the nose of this bottling from this historic vineyard. There is great depth to its flavors—a layering of dark raspberry thyme, anise and dill—while showing plenty of turned earth notes throughout.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This almost white rosé is produced from selected parcels of the estate. Citrus and pepper dominate, supported by ripe red fruits and delicate acidity. It is a beautiful wine, elegant and with a fine balance between the fruit and the crisp texture. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The blend of old-vine Cinsault with Mourvèdre has produced a dense wonderfully perfumed wine. Rich in tannins, it also shows great black fruits and equally great concentration. This is a powerful wine that will be ready from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blended from eight separate vineyards, this appellation wine doesn't hold back on quality. It offers a seamless, integrated foundation of juicy cherry, cranberry and orange flavors, dusted with cardamom spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A light rendition of the variety given time in bottle to mellow, this is a stand-out wine redolent of black olive, fig and gamy, sanguine meat. Delicately peppered, it slowly unravels its layers of blueberry and cherry fruit, complementing its savory register of flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 44% Syrah, 31% Grenache and 25 Mourvèdre, this wine is aromatically very pure, with plenty of red and blue fruit, speckled with bay leaf, herb and black-pepper accents. It possesses a thrilling plush mouthfeel, with olive and black-fruit flavors, showing a fine sense of purity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Slight pepper spice mingles with subdued, tart berry fruit on the nose of this wine. The palate adds supple vanilla and strawberry notes, with fine, smooth tannins and pervasive freshness. For now, the vanilla still dominates, but a little bottle age will help. Drink 2018–2022.\n",

      "This is a new wine designed to be a “grown-up rosé” from the Cronk family who moved from London to Provence in 2009. It is a ripe fruity and rich blend of Grenache and Syrah. Weight as well as contrasting acidity give a structured character that balances well with the intense fruitiness. Drink the wine from late 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The star of the winery's lineup, this subtle svelte wine offers the classic velvet-glove mouthfeel. It's silky and yet rich, with strawberry and cherry-pastry-filling goodness. Textural and lingering, it's a fine testament to the potential of Pinot Noir in this cool climate AVA.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The high alcohol may be a stumbling block for some palates, but this wine is nonetheless absolutely delicious. Sourced from a vineyard planted in 1972, it was aged in 50% new French oak. It's intense and detailed, with hints of wintergreen, a broad streak of cherry cola, and finishing licks of molasses, brown sugar and coffee.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Classic lychee and rose petal aromas perfume this ripe yet elegantly composed Gewürztraminer. Juicy and forward yet balanced and spry, it calibrates zesty tangerine acidity against a crystalline glaze of honey that lingers on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark strawberry fruit meets with rustic earthy aromas and light allspice notes on the nose of this wine from the late actor's family-owned winery. The palate shows boisterous and tart cranberry and black raspberry fruit, with pencil lead minerality and great energy, if not a ton of complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Slightly shy aromas of blackberry, black plum and turned black soil are simple and straightforward on this wine. The palate combines pencil lead with anise, thyme, marjoram and black pepper, framed by tart cranberry, beet juice and sour-cherry fruit. A sip enlivens the mouth and wipes clean on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A relic of times gone by in the Napa Valley, this 100% varietal Charbono is dark purple in color and compelling in its aromas of leather saddle and baked bread. Crisp acidity underlies ripe blueberry and plum flavors that never go over the top, complementing a velvety texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of pineapple, guava, citrus blossom and mango lead the way to flavors of lemon peel, lemon curd, toasted bitter almond and green apple. It's bright on entry with a strong backbone of minerality.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deep ruby to the eye, this wine has an intriguing nose of cherry, rose and fennel bulb. It is soft in the mouth yet it fills the entire palate with flavors of cherry, pomegranate, fennel bulb and white chocolate. Light yet ever-present tannins continue into the soft finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Forest floor, truffle, baked plum, eucalyptus and baking spice unfold on this structured red. The linear, elegant palate offers dried black cherry, clove, ground pepper and tobacco framed in polished, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Black plum, dark kitchen spice, leather and pressed violet aromas lead the nose on this round, savory wine. On the velvety palate, firm, polished tannins frame mature black cherry, licorice and a hint of chewing tobacco. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's no denying that this is a heavily oaked Rioja with toast, resin, vanilla and cheesy aromas alongside fully ripe blackberry and prune notes. There's energy to the palate, while previously mentioned heavy oak spawns flavors of vanilla and spice to go with berry fruit. A mouth-coating, woody finish stands out on this compartmentalized Tempranillo-led blend. Drink through 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of ripe berry, forest floor, leather and menthol lead the way. The firm, savory palate doles out juicy black cherry, licorice, grilled porcini and well-integrated oak framed in fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pine resin and a light, oily brine character define the nose on this lithe, fresh fino. Crisp acidity and healthy weight mesh into balance on an easy-to-navigate palate. Flavors of almond, sea brine and toffee finish crisp.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich and warm, this is a big, ripe wine. Toasted marshmallow notes frame honeyed pineapple, while hints of singed fruit and mocha linger on the finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an attractively herbal rendering of Côtes du Rhône Villages, offering hints of flowering thyme, sage and rosemary that are rounded out by flavors of just-ripe cherries. It's a medium-bodied wine, with a long on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of freshly baked bread, toast and melon are soft and welcoming. This Pinot Noir-led Cava feels plump, with moderate acidity. Flavors of melon, quince and pear finish mild, with only a bit of kick.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This doesn't boast the most expressive nose but aromas of baked black plum, espresso and scorched earth slowly unfold. The warm, concentrated palate reflects the heat of the vintage, revealing blackberry jam, licorice and a hint of chewing tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Cabernet Franc from Hungary has aromas of tart cherry, black plum and purple flowers. It is a medium- to full-bodied wine with flavors of tart cherry, pomegranate and cranberry juice. The tannins are soft and the finish is persistent.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lively aromas, an appetizing balance and just-rich-enough fruit flavors make a good combo in this medium- to full-bodied wine. It has subtle herb and kiwi aromas, crisp apple flavors, and a texture poised between supple and tangy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Slovenian Sauvignon Blanc has aromas of lemon grass and freshly mowed lawn. It is sharp on entry with flavors of lime juice, orange zest and grapefruit before the bright acidic finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Named after the road on which the winery sits, this wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah. Coffee, herb and cherry aromas are followed by black olive and cherry flavors with the Syrah expressing itself prominently.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mature dark-skinned berry, forest floor, truffle and chopped herb aromas unfold in the glass. The chewy palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry, licorice and an earthy hint of game alongside firm tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Heavily fragrant purple fruit, from baked blueberry to fresh boysenberry jam, meets with melted dark chocolate, black rocks and mint leaf-topped cola on the nose of this Tannat, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot blend. Blackberry juice, caramel cream and coffee flavors show on the palate that is laced with soft tannins and a ton of acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark coffee, dried herb and whole green-pepper aromas mix with notes of cherry, black plum and vanilla. The black-fruit flavors are rich but still show a sense of elegance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot make up the majority of this blend. High-toned aromas of dried herbs, tobacco, bell pepper, dark fruit and spice lead to pleasingly plump, well-balanced fruit flavors. It leans a touch into the green but still delivers a lot of enjoyment.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Equal parts Syrah and Merlot (40%), this wine is finished off with Pinot Noir. Vanilla, baking spice, licorice, woodspice and cherry aromas lead to plump, tart cranberry flavors that linger. The wood is heavy at times, which is a shame as the balance of the fruit is spot on.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With grapes from 40-year-old vines, this is a dense and concentrated wine. Yellow fruit as well as crisper citrus flavors give a balance between richness and freshness. It has high alcohol that shows in the light pepper edge although this doesn't detract from the fruitiness of the aftertaste. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A whiff of bergamot lends musky floral intensity to this peachy featherweight wine. It's perfumed but not at all cloying, etched finely with a lingering lace of crystalline sugar. Drink now through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 40% Furmint, 40% Pinot Gris and 20% Riesling has aromas of pineapple, lychee fruit and fresh herbs. It's thin and racy in the mouth with flavors of mango, apple and guava.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This round, structured Syrah opens with aromas of ripe black fruit, tilled soil and ground black pepper. The palate shows mature blackberry and raspberry together with notes of spice and clove. Velvety tannins provide the framework.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of baked plum, vanilla, menthol and star anise lead the nose. The ripe, robust palate offers fig, raisin, licorice, dried mint and tobacco alongside solid tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to soften up then drink to capture the remaining fruit richness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sesame oil, cracked peppercorns, pencil lead and charred oak serve as the savory side to aromatic elements of dried strawberries and olallieberries on the nose of this bottling. Upright but not chunky tannins frame the palate, where dried blueberry, beef char and rosemary converge for a complex and very dry flavor profile.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This dense and dark wine offers spice and toast flavors. It has a big, generous feel, leaving room both for the dry, still-young tannins and for aromatic blackberry fruits. It does need to age, so drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Winemaker Nick Goldschmidt does wonders with this consistent vineyard source, coaxing out mocha-chocolate, black cherry and blackberry, never overpowering an earthy back note of tobacco. Medium-bodied and soft, it finishes in a swirl of smoke and is juicy and enjoyable now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The 91-acre Grézels vineyard surrounds a 12th-century castle. This revived historic vineyard has produced a well-structured wine that is rich, despite its modest alcohol. It is dense with tannins and black fruits that are developing into a smoother texture. The wine needs to age further, so drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a beautifully balanced, medium-bodied wine that's not too deep in color. It smells like ripe blackberries and has a whiff of wood smoke in the bright berry flavors. In the blend, Zinfandel is supplemented with Syrah, Petite Sirah and Carignane.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cabernet Sauvignon is blessed with 9% Merlot, coming together in a seamlessly rich wine intense in dark chocolate, coconut and vanilla. Soft, the tannins are integrated and the juiciness of the fruit concentrated, finishing with more of that rich taste of chocolate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Black as night in the glass, this wine shows black cherries, lava rocks and espresso beans on the dense nose. It's thick and chewy once sipped, with zesty acidity that sizzles across the palate, showing blackberry and coffee flavors. It's all power, with very little finesse. Sales of the wine benefit multiple sclerosis research.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made in a relatively restrained style, this is a dark, juicy and smoky wine from Dry Creek and Alexander Valley area vineyard sites. Lengthy and smooth, it takes a decidedly medium-bodied route, with traces of leather pouch on the nose and a soft layering of milk chocolate on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine offers aromas of raspberry and toffee. There is a nice interplay of fruit, floral, and minty flavors, notably raspberry, cherry, toffee, rose petal and eucalyptus. Mildly gripping tannins make themselves evident, and fruit flavors remain prominent through the smooth finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bramble and dried herbs, pressed apple and peach notes blend elements of savory and sweet in this complex Spätlese. Shimmering lemon-lime acidity refreshes the midpalate, leaving lingering tones of finely crushed mineral.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While racy and spry, this delicately framed wine packs a punch of honeyed peach and nectarine flavors. It's effusively fresh, floral and fruity, yet accentuated by a crystalline sheen of minerality. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A hint of bramble wafts amidst crisp Asian pear and green apple notes on this invigorating spry Spätlese. Searing lemon-lime acidity is softened by a plump kiss of honeyed apricot on the midpalate. It's elegant, yet accessible, and drinks well now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While dry in style and crisply balanced, plump white peaches and apricots shine brightly in this silky Pinot Blanc. It's rich and round with a slightly clingy mouthfeel but not at all cloying or dense. Enjoy now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A bit tight and dainty on the nose, with reserved apple custard and white-flower aromas, this top-level bottling shows lots of nerve and verve once sipped. It offers salt, lime juice and honeysuckle on the palate, with lots of tension that lasts long after the bottle has been opened. It's a well-structured white.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The natural richness of a Pouilly-Fumé is revealed well here. Plenty of mineral, herbaceous flavors contrast with the ripe yellow and pear fruit flavors. It is generous and full in the mouth, still young and needing to age. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bottling offers plum and plump blackberry on the nose along with milk chocolate, leather and cedar. It's quite tight and tannic on the palate at first, but all the expected and delicious components are in place: tart blueberry, tobacco, coffee and hints of licorice and chocolate that will emerge emerge more with time.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a wine that reveals the younger side of Moscatel in Setúbal. It shows honey, spice and perfumed fruitiness that contrast with the richness of the texture and its fresh peach and apricot flavors. Drink now for immediate enjoyment.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with aromas of mature dark fruit, toast and a slight whiff of cellar floor. The palate is still tight and rather closed, but offers fleshy black cherry, toasted oak, clove and mocha alongside polished tannins. It's fast approaching its ideal drinking window so enjoy sooner rather than later.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offers aromas of violet, rose, Marasca cherry and a whiff of cake spice that carry over to the warm palate along with a whiff of toast. Tightly packed tannins give it a firm finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Engaging aromas of fresh rose, iris, perfumed berry and hint of menthol meld together in the glass. On the taut palate, notes of white pepper, clove and anise add some depth to the sour cherry core. Assertive tannins and nervous acidity offer focused support while a hint of juicy raspberry backs up the finish. Drink 2018–2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While honey and white peach flavors ring pure and sweet, there's a slatey, mineral tone that penetrates deeply in this off-dry Kabinett. It's nervy and brisk, finishing long with zesty lime pith bitterness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full in the mouth, this rich wine is dominated by yellow fruits and ripe apricots lifted by a touch of toast. Great acidity conveys a fresh and tangy character. The wine is still developing as the full fruitiness comes forward. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose is initially rather closed but eventually reveals baked earth, leather, game and ripe black fruit. The taut, tense palate offers dried black cherry, toasted oak, mocha and vanilla alongside grainy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fragrant and bright, this offers aromas of rose, iris, perfumed berry and a balsamic note. The palate is still rather closed, offering raw red cherry, star anise and chopped sage alongside tightly knit tannins and brisk acidity. It still needs time to come together. Drink 2018–2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From vines planted in 1958 in an appellation that straddles both Sonoma and Mendocino counties, this is an intriguing, interesting wine, mostly varietal, with 8% each of Mourvèdre and Syrah. Floral, it veers into leather and game, with a juicy backbone of red cherry and berry and earthy, textured tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A velvety, sinewy blend of 40% Syrah, 40% Grenache and 20% Mourvèdre from estate-grown and nearby vineyards, this wine offers a lot to like, from textured tannins to succulent blueberry and plum. Intense and floral, it finishes with an explosion of white pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rose, red berry, mint and anise aromas unfold in the glass. The firm palate offers wild cherry, crushed raspberry, clove, anisette and a mocha note framed in bracing tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2020–2031.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Brioche and vanilla-cherry are the stars in this full-bodied yet savory, herbal wine sourced mostly from the Oak Knoll District. Complex in flavor, it spikes in clove and cinnamon, finishing with a taste of gunpowder and tobacco.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offers aromas of toast, espresso, scorched earth, red berry, clove and a whiff of leather. The lean, tense palate offers dried cherry, grilled herb, anise, coffee and tobacco but not much fruit richness. Tightly wound, bracing tannins and nervous acidity provide the framework.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a fourth-generation farming family, this wine is sourced from the Niebaum-Tonella and Morisoli-Borges vineyards along the Rutherford Bench. It opens with a bouquet of sweetly ripened mango, peach and pear, which continue on the palate. Fierce acidity and a drop of anise form the backdrop of the wine, which finishes somewhat tropical.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wild berries, from elderberry to salmonberry to mountain strawberries, are in play in this wine. The underpinning scents suggest earth and wet cement, while in the finish a strong flavor of breakfast tea lingers. This is an interesting addition to the Sineann lineup.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light plum and raspberry aromas include notes of animal and latex. This lightweight Garnacha has a monotone mouthfeel, while hollow simple berry flavors finish with acidic tang.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The bell pepper, cedar and green bean notes in this wine come across as astringent and thin.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a rustic, barnyard-scented wine, with tannins and acidity but lacking fruit. Think of it as one to quaff without too much thought.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a lightly aromatic wine, with faint aromas of melon, lemon-lime and yellow flowers. The palate is soft and thin, with similarly delicate flavors as the nose. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Herbal tomato and red-berry aromas are jumbled and fail to state much of a case for this multigrape blend. Herbal spicy tea and raspberry flavors finish jagged, with mild heat.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Unconvincing aromas are hard to describe. This Malbec sparkler is coarse and foamy on the palate, with burnt peppery slightly bitter flavors of orange and grapefruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is a lightly yeasty character to this wine that gives it a bitter edge, hindering its fruitiness and crisp apple acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend is so oaky and sticky on the nose that it smells like a Hershey's Kiss. The palate is out of balance, with chunky weight and unintegrated acidity. Like the nose, this tastes like a drugstore chocolate bar, while the finish is hot.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Reduced jammy black-fruit aromas announce a scratchy palate with spritz. This multigrape blend tastes saucy and stewed, while hard tannins and a note of burnt coffee control the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is sour, flat and past its prime, showing an abundance of tar and oak qualities.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sharp red-fruit aromas include notes of vinegar and asphalt. Angular and bumpy on the palate, this is tart and foxy tasting, with a sour, herbal finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas come off as quite volatile, making it difficult to get at the tart cherry aromas and flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This gold-colored stale-smelling Torrontés smells like old apple juice. A chunky flat palate offers bland oxidized bitter flavors. Remnants of apple barely help a bitter finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend smells outright herbaceous and weedy. An astringent volatile palate is grating, while this tastes much like it smells: weedy and green.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Clove and beef jerky aromas are odd and forceful. A globular palate lacks form and balance, while this tastes oddly and singularly of clove.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full of ripe fruit, opulent and concentrated, this is a fabulous and impressive wine. It has a beautiful line of acidity balanced with ripe fruits. The wood aging is subtle, just a hint of smokiness and toast. This is one of those wines, from a great white wine vintage, that will age many years. Drink from 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Perfumed berry, rose, new leather and dark spice are some of the enticing scents you'll find in this vibrant wine. It's still tightly wound but already dazzles with juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, nutmeg and pipe tobacco flavors. Youthfully austere but noble tannins and bright acidity provide balance and serious aging potential. Don't be tempted to open it soon—the best is yet to come. Drink 2022–2042.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Immensely inviting, this opens with fragrant pipe tobacco, crushed berry, new leather and pressed violet aromas. On the palate, firm, refined tannins underpin juicy black cherry, raspberry and cinnamon flavors, while orange zest accents and an energizing mineral note lift the finish. It's beautifully balanced with bright acidity and will reward a bit of cellaring. Drink 2020–2032.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full-bodied and plush yet vibrant and imbued with fresh fruit, this is simply superb. The oak is present but never dominant, adding brown sugar and cinnamon elements to blueberry, roasted meat, espresso and black olive notes. A hint of peppery spice also creeps into this impossibly complex wine. The finish combines power, length, freshness and dusty tannins, suggesting that while impressive now, it should age well. Drink now–2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pretty as all get-out, this wine is a floral masterpiece—a study in coastal rose and forest scents with a counterpunch of white pepper that leaves one wanting more. Juicy raspberry, strawberry and tangerine flavors are seasoned in allspice and tobacco, the palate so beautifully delicate yet fully realized in savory complexity and length.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Balancing power and grace, this wine delivers alluring aromas and flavors of ripe black cherry, raspberry compote, grilled herb, licorice and tar. Vibrant acidity and firm, velvety tannins provide freshness and structure, while a hint of pipe tobacco closes the lingering finish. Drink 2020–2032.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a rich, finely structured wine. It is highly perfumed, packed with black fruits and a dark, firm texture. At the same time, the acidity is intense and the structure tight, suggesting a wine to age. Beautifully endowed with great fruit, it will take time to develop. Drink from 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a great wine. It has all the elements in place to produce a wine that will last for years: powerful fruit, rich tannins and a structure that is built to last. This is elegant, impressive and concentrated. Almost entirely Cabernet Sauvignon, the grape gives the wine its fruit and its tannins. Drink from 2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It's easy to call this a beautiful wine—it's dense and lush, with great layers of black fruit and acidity. The first fully biodynamic vintage from this estate has certainly yielded impressive ripe fruit, with structured tannins and dark berry flavors that linger long. It has enormous potential, certainly not be ready to drink before 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a structured wine with its tight acidity and concentrated white and citrus fruits. Produced from a small parcel on the Chevalier estate, it is complex with its mineral texture, its touch of pepper and its fine herbal acidity. It is a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is a sense of pure juicy black-currant fruit that shoots through this great wine. With tannins that are firm while not a jot too much, the wine is crisp, packed with fruit and set for many years of aging. It is beautiful, fruity and intensely structured. Drink from 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a very fine wine showing a new level of quality at Montrose. With its almost velvet tannins inside the intense black fruits, the wine is rich, smooth and generous. Blackberry and black-plum fruits are to the fore along with the fine acidity and great structure. A wine to age for decades, it will be ready to drink from 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dense and beautifully ripe, this is a rounded rich wine. It focuses on the tropical yellow-fruit spectrum. That gives a full wine with wood-spice hints and just the right amount of citrus acidity to give it a lift. Drink this finely structured wine from 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This grand wine is stylish and elegant. It is also powerful and dense with dark tannins and great concentration. It is a very fine wine, packed with black plum and berry fruits and balanced richness. Don't let the great fruit deceive: this is a wine for the serious long term. Drink from 2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With seriously dense tannins, this shows great structure. Rich and full of ripe fruit, it also has a fresh streak that gives it a lift. The structure will allow the wine to age over many years while the fruit and acidity will give it crispness. Drink this impressive wine from 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Chocolate, coconut, plum and coffee aromas lead the nose on this densely concentrated wine. The monolithic palate offers black cherry, chocolate-covered coconut and oak alongside astringent tannins that dry out the mouth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Milk chocolate and pomegranate curiously mix in this mid-weight, lowly oaked nonvintage Cabernet, blended with 18% Merlot and 2% Petite Sirah. New American oak aged most of it, with a bit of French, too, only 25% of the whole new.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe, rich cassis and blackberry flavors are shaded with savory touches of soy sauce and clay in this bold, lushly textured wine. Soft acidity makes this wine plush and plump on the palate, but its fruity exuberance is quite pleasant.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot shows an uneasy mix of green coffee bean, cherry, char and meaty notes. The cherry flavors are medium bodied backed by a wall of firm, dry tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a deep-colored, ripe wine, with touches of wood well embedded in the spicy, rich blackberry fruits. The wine is juicy, with dry, dusty tannins promising some aging. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A very subtle aroma leads to a rich feel on the palate, where ripe plum and soft berry flavors emerge. This wine is totally smooth, warm and plush, full bodied but with soft tannins that make it easy to sip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot finished off with 5% Cabernet Franc, this cool-vintage wine is light in color. Notes of plum and cranberries come with herb and floral accents. It's light and lively with elegant, pretty fruit flavors backed by mouthwatering acidity with a lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Scents of lemon-cake icing meet the pretty yet not treacly tropical aromatics of white flowers on this barely off-dry wine. The sweetness is noticeable on the palate but far from overdone, with clean flavors of lemon custard, tangerine juice and a Key-lime finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This smells oaky and tastes ripe and pure, like crushed blackberries and raspberries. It feels plush and smooth in the mouth, finishing on the soft side. While medium bodied, it has just a touch of tannin to balance the ripeness and make it appetizing to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Damp earth and forest floor mark this wine, a blend of various clones, the majority of which are Pommard. Red raspberry and cherry compete for attention aromatically and in taste, followed by a spiciness of Christmas clove.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This tastes honest, clean and direct, with a nice mixture of fruity, woody and savory herbal aromas and flavors. It's medium in body and offers just a touch of tannin to add a little grip to the texture. A tasty raspberry note gives it even more personality.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This warm-climate wine is fulsome and hearty in baked Asian pear and candied ginger. A dried-fruit quality stands out on the buxom palate, a buttery taste of dried apricot drizzled in honey and brioche.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This aromatic wine offers notes of jasmine, quinine, flowers and peach. It drinks medium sweet with lightly spritzy stone-fruit flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a slightly sour, forest-floor funkiness to the nose of this wine from an historic appellation near Hollister. Not boasting much ripe fruit on the palate, the flavors lean toward leather and earth, with fine tannins, nice acidity and hints of licorice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a lightness to this 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot that surprises, making for a friendly, approachable entry. Cassis, raspberry and cedar mix around rounded tannins and a medium-length finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose is broad and welcoming, with apple and pear flesh aromas touched with vanilla and struck match. The palate shows good tension between lemon pith and roasted apple, proving quite focused and grippy with tannins, although a tad hot.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Moderately aromatic, this suggests melon, grapefruit and pear. It drinks off dry (8g/L residual sugar) with pink-grapefruit flavors and good balance. It keeps you coming back for more.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe red cherry and plum flavors are plump and plush in this rich, full-bodied wine. Soft acidity adds to its easy feel, but grippy, fine-grained tannins help to rein in the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine shows a mixture of fruit and barrel notes, with vanilla, coffee bean and milk chocolate playing off plum and cherry. It's soft and plush in feel, trailing toward the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Waxy white florals and lifted apple aromas add freshness to slightly cider-like flavors of pressed apple and mulling spice in this dry Riesling. Delicately light bodied it has a brisk, refreshing finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blended from several stellar vineyard sites, including La Cruz and Devoto, this wine presents a brightness of acidity and crisp, red fruit. These are offset by a heartier uptake of oak and tannin that feels out of place compared to many of the producer's single-vineyard offerings. On the finish, expect tart cranberry and pomegranate to peak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of spiced strawberry pie and wet slate emerge on this wine from a brand that seeks to offer quality at affordable prices. The palate shows medium-intense cranberry fruit, with a hint of anise spice. It's fairly straightforward and ideal for nightly sipping.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Stalky, grassy, briny aromas of red-berry fruits run low on ripeness. This is tangy and tomatoey in feel, with tart plum and tomato flavors. A snappy, zesty, crisp finish is raw and cutting. Drink this wine now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Jammy, candied aromas suggest cherry Kool-Aid. This Carignan-Grenache-Syrah blend is narrow and juicy in feel, with raw red-fruit flavors that are also candied and suggestive of animal. This is decent but raw on the finish and overall does not deliver much pleasure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy, spicy aromas of juniper, bell pepper and oak cover up slightly underripe berry scents. This has an acceptable level of tannic scratch and peppery, herbal berry fruit flavors. Like the rest of this Cab, the finish is lightly herbal, green-leaning and hard.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas seem quite muddled with coffee, cranberry and currant fighting to get through. It's lighter in style with the variety seeming to get lost.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas recall coffee, toast and weedy underbrush. The lean palate offers licorice, espresso, black pepper and dried fruit flavors alongside clenched, aggressive tannins. While the tannins need to unwind, it lacks the fruit richness for lengthy aging. You'll also notice the heat of alcohol on the close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Berry, dried sage, licorice and menthol aromas lead the nose. The warm, one-dimensional palate offers toasted oak, coconut, spirit-soaked prune and vanilla alongside sharp, astringent tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of oak, toast and coconut carry through to the palate along with spirit-soaked plum, fig and anisette. It doesn't have enough fruit richness to support the extremely astringent wood tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Black currant fruits dust the aromas of this wine. The palate shows a stalky character, with dusty tannins and a dry core. It's old school Bordeaux, tough when young and needing time. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This unoaked, Dijon-clone wine is lively and lush, with tongue-coating fruit. Melon, banana and papaya flavors steer it in a tropical direction, with a lick of mineral and phenolic bite giving further support.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spanish broom, jasmine, peach and apple aromas lead the nose of this charming white that hails from an estate located just outside of Rome. The juicy palate delivers Golden Delicious apple, tropical fruit and a hint of mineral. It finishes on an apple note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soft and earthy, this wine's herbal, funky nature suggests Carneros as much as Sonoma Coast, with black tea and crunchy dried cranberry lurking on the back of the palate. Medium in weight, it eases into a mellow finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here is a well-focused wine with appealing toastiness as soon as it's opened. Fruit flavors are still tight, but unfold into tangy raspberry. It spent 18 months in half new French oak, to good effect.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Stripped-back cherry and raspberry flavors take on a jammy character with airing. This is tight, bright and mildly acidic on the palate, with raspberry, red plum and brown sugar flavors. Toast and a molasses-like sweetness carry an otherwise juicy finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tempting buttery flavors and a lively texture combine well in this medium-bodied wine. It smells a bit like butterscotch, and this note continues in the flavors, where fresh lemon and Bosc pear notes also emerge. It's complex for an unoaked style.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Profoundly floral, this aromatic white balances ebullient violet and lavender perfume against crisp grapefruit and gooseberry flavors. Made from the Rivaner grape (also known as Müller-Thurgau), it's an exotic, yet dry, refreshing wine. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This rich, almost sweet wine owes a lot of its exuberance to the flavors that oak barrels impart—toasted, smoky, seemingly sweet but not sugary notes like maple syrup. Ripe black cherry and boysenberry flavors blend in too. The mouthfeel is dense but not harsh, as the layers of fine-textured tannins add shape without a lot of weight.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This four-variety blend shows that crisp, refreshing white wines can emerge from the Southern Rhône. Hints of pineapple, pear and mandarin orange mark this medium-bodied white. Drink now–2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mild aromas of cherry and nectarine come across simple and sweet. Following the nose's lead, this is mellow on the palate, with raspberry and cherry flavors that are, once again, a bit sweet in character. A controlled, candied finish is consistent with what came before it.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe melon and grapefruit flavors are plush and pristine in this forward off-dry Riesling. Zesty tangerine acidity brightens the midpalate and leads a moderately long, sugar-cookie finish. It's a refreshing, fruity quaffer intended for youthful consumption.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is attractive in a bright, fruit-driven style. Bright berry fruit is tinged with apricot and cocoa on the midpalate, then finishes firm and dusty.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A light but flavorful and dry bubbly, this has a pale pink color and frothy effervescence. Aromas like red cherries and peaches lead to tasty, lively fruit flavors. It has a refreshing, tart texture that's not too severe, and a soft finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full, intense blackberry aromas skirt complexity but score points via power and grit. Rubbery tannins and plenty of oak give this weight and strength, while flavors of blackberry, black currant and chocolate are ripe and good. A toasty, oaky finish reveals enough blackberry flavor to make this right.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This medium-bodied blend of Grenache (70%), Syrah (25%) and Mourvèdre (5%) is aged in large oak vats. Leather and spice notes accent modest cherry fruit, then fold in touches of black olive and mocha on the slightly dusty finish. Drink now–2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Although it's young, this wine has seen some time in oak, which has given it a ripe fruity character balanced by toast. It's rich and full with balancing acidity and a spicy aftertaste. It needs to age a few months, so drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Syrah opens with aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit, ground black pepper and a whiff of cedar that all carry over to the dense, one-dimensional palate, along with a licorice note. It's balanced by firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light pops of cherry and raspberry aromas emerge from a low-volume, feminine bouquet. This Trepat is typically fresh, with a lean body and citric acidity. Peppery red-fruit flavors include modestly applied oak, while the finish is long, and lightly spiced, with unspecific red-berry flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With a vivid golden color, bold and buttery aromas, and rich, almost nutty flavors, this is a full-bore rendering. It is full bodied and brings out the most flavorful aspects of the grape. The texture is rich and almost thick, and the buttery nuances linger on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A fruity, forward nose of melon, citrus and guava aromas comes with a hint of match stick. Vivacious and lively on the tongue, this delivers a bolt of grapefruit flavor leading to pithy green notes of bell pepper and scallion through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of dark berry, violet, vanilla and a whiff of toast lead the nose on this bright, sleek red. Made from 70% Sangiovese and 30% Merlot, the firm but accessible palate delivers sour cherries, black raspberries, cocoa and dried aromatic herbs alongside zesty acidity and fine-grained tannins. Enjoy through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromatic and drinking at its peak, this remains fresh, tart and tangy, with palate-penetrating boysenberry and blueberry fruit. Think Lemberger meets Pinot Noir and you have a sense of it, albeit with a slightly rustic edge.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of mocha, espresso, coconut, ripe black-skinned fruit and new wood lead the nose on this hearty blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc, 25% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot. The thickly concentrated palate offers up dried black cherry, roasted coffee beans, toasted oak and vanilla alongside astringent tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A new venture to the Douro by Tejo-based Lagoalva, this is juicy, fruity and soft. While it misses the minerality of many Douro wines, it does have ripe plum fruit flavors, and an open, generous texture. This is a warm full-bodied wine that's ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Delicate and dry, this offers lightly spicy strawberry fruit and supporting acids. It's pretty and pale, light but not dilute, and would be an ideal match to a pork dish with a fruit sauce.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fruity and easygoing, this blend of 60% Sangiovese and 40% Syrah doles out crushed black cherry, blackberry, spiced blueberry, white pepper and clove. Supple tannins support the juicy flavors and give it a smooth texture. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made entirely with Sangiovese, this offers scents of blue flowers, ripe berry and mocha. The simple, forward palate delivers fleshy black cherry, vanilla, chocolate, oak and a confectionary note alongside velvety tannins and the warmth of alcohol. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Young vine flavors of bright raspberry fruit shine through, backed with juicy, tongue-tickling acids. This is not a complex wine, but fresh, persistent and lightly spicy. Drink it while it retains its vibrancy, now through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soft and forward, this has a plush mouthfeel, a mix of banana marshmallows and lemon meringue pie. It's quite tasty and easy-drinking, so give it a light chill and drink up while it remains young and fresh.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sangiovese gets a spicy lift from 5% Alicante on this bright, easy drinking wine. It offers scents of blue flowers, plum, blackberry and baking spice while the smooth, savory palate delivers crushed black cherry, white pepper and aniseed. Bright acidity and refined tannins lend it balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% Zin comes from one of Paso Robles' most famous vineyards. The briary blackberry and mulberry flavors are very ripe, veering into chocolate-covered raisins. Although the alcohol is high, the wine pulls it all off, never losing its balance. Above all, it's a delight to drink now. Barbecue and short ribs come to mind as great partners.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The top wine from Tendil & Lombardi, it's warm, ripe, richly textured and fruity. It has a soft character, creamy and full in the mouth. Delicate apple acidity cuts through the ripe peach fruits to give a wine that shows both charm and serious structure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From old Lodi vines, V. Sattui's annual heartland Zin is minty and herbal, high-toned and tannic, able to find a nice equilibrium between opposing personalities. Leathery and akin to pipe tobacco, it offers a more savory side of Zin, and is worthy of cellaring until 2019 or so.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A full-bodied, ripe and juicy wine that is developing well. It has weight, soft and warm tannins and already delicious fruit. Blackberries dominate, supported by acidity and a solid core of drier structure. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Elegantly structured, it starts with aromas of cut grass, stone fruit and pineapple alongside whiffs of mineral and Alpine herbs. The smooth, linear palate delivers white peach, apple, lime, exotic fruit and flinty minerality plus crisp acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dry, bold and intensely mineral, this powerful Riesling is lifted by whiffs of lemongrass and mint, along with a shining streak of lemon acidity. It finishes with a bristle of lime zest astringency and a hint of white flower.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The 2012 has more stuffing than the previous vintage, offering round, pretty fruit flavors of hard cherry candy. There's a streak of red licorice also, balanced acids and tannins, and the length and depth to reward further aging.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fields Family aims for balance from 60-year-old vines, aiming to produce refined Zins with subtle power. They've achieved that here, offering velvety texture and a taste of raspberry liqueur and nuanced vanilla amid an elegant core of chocolate-laced tannin.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Grande in all senses, this wine comes in a powerfully heavy bottle. The wine itself is very structured with ripe and dense tannins and concentrated black, juicy fruits. It comes from selected parcels in Rocim, and is only made in top years. Age this powerful wine and drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas hint at the wood aging of this rich wine, while the palate also brings out the rich and structured fruits. Dense and with great red berry fruitiness, it has a fine sense of smokiness, acidity and tannins that act as a solid support. It is still developing, so don't drink before 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pushes all the right Chardonnay buttons, with creamy tropical mango, papaya, pineapple and lime flavors. It also folds in buttered toast, vanilla and honey notes from oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Attaché brings appealing and lively cherry fruit, framed with citrusy acidity. The power in this wine is all forward and fruit-driven. It's quite good, but more for immediate drinking than cellaring.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Classic Santa Lucia Pinot Noir, big, bold and delicious. What it lacks in delicacy it more than makes up for in ripe, jammy fruit. Raspberries and cherries star, with pretty notes of vanilla and toast from oak barrel aging. Drink now, but decant it for an hour or two.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It opens with a delicate floral fragrance of white spring flowers accented by a whiff of apple and Alpine herbs. The steely, linear palate delivers juicy yellow apples together with a mineral note and lively acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It opens with intense aromas of tropical fruit, green apples and a note of Mediterranean herbs. The juicy palate delivers white peach, pear, banana, papaya and almond alongside bright acidity that leaves a clean, refreshing finish. Drink now through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bone dry and tart, this is made without oak, allowing the grape's natural acidity and flavors to star. There's a minerality to the lemons and limes, with hints of vanilla and white pepper. What a glorious partner for oysters on the half shell.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc opens with aromas of cherries, berries, blue flower, sun-baked earth and a hint of balsamic herbs. The ripe palate delivers fleshy black cherry, milk chocolate, espresso and black pepper alongside chewy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big, ripe and juicy, this solidly based wine also has great fruitiness. Black fruits, some bitter chocolate and licorice point to ripeness and wood aging. It has a rich texture, its spiciness bringing out the plum and damson fruits. For aging over the medium-term, drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It shows great depth of flavor, with delicious fresh berries, black fruits, balanced acidity and fragrance. The tannins are present, but given a great lift by the fruitiness. A wine to drink over the medium-term, from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a small parcel in the Lamothe-Vincent vineyard, this rich, structured wine shows a strong relationship with terroir and minerality. It has power and intensity, while still preserving enough freshness. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Petit Verdot seems right at home in the southern Alentejo. This wine is fully ripe, powerful and genuinely fruity. Very juicy and packed with black fruits, it's full-bodied and dense. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine shows some of the natural tannic structure of the Douro while really bringing out plenty of fruit. It is rich, full of black fruits, ripe berries and elegant acidity. Firm and fruity at the end, it could age until 2016, but is good to drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "For a wine from the 2011 vintage, this ripe wine has plenty of weight. It's in the fruity, fresh spectrum but this is sustained by a young, solid and tannic core. Full of red fruits and sweet final acidity, it's for medium-term aging.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Perfumed fruits offer a ripe counterpoint to the solid tannins. Dark cherries, a touch of wood and layers of acidity come together well, leaving the chance to age further. Drink until 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This juicy, fruit-forward Pinot Noir has fresh and primary aromas of ripe blackberries and cherries. Intense cranberry acidity and hints of dark toast and spice add balance and elegance. It's unabashedly pleasant drinking, but structured enough to carry well over the next 3–5 years.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The lightly delicate mouthfeel and brisk acidity testify to the wine's origins in cool-climate Marin, just over the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. Intense flavors of strawberries and raspberries are uplifted by the toastiness of new French oak. This is a promising Pinot Noir for drinking now through 2018.\n",

      "Made entirely from Trebbiano di Soave, this bright wine has a subdued nose that reveals white floral notes, tree fruit and mineral. The creamy, savory palate is much more expressive, delivering tart apples, ripe pear, white spice, mint and mineral alongside crisp acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A ripe and fruity wine, it has great red fruits, dark cherries and soft, juicy acidity. The structured tannins add a delicious whisper behind all this fruitiness. This is a warm, rich wine, ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It's high in alcohol, but without it, this Zin just wouldn't be as good as it is. It's bone dry and full bodied, and the crushed black peppercorn, blackberry and licorice flavors have a roasty, toasty edge that makes the wine particularly savory.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Something about this blush makes you think of warm spring and summer nights, sitting outside with friends. It's dry, crisp and clean, with strawberry, orange rind, vanilla and white pepper flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Getting quality Pinot Noir for $20 remains a tough trick to pull, but this succeeds with fresh raspberry, white pepper and wet rock aromas. The flavors are delicate, ranging from cherry to cedar to Italian herbs, with some noticeable complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is heavily spiced from its wood aging. Fresher fruit flavors do come through to give black currants, bright acidity as well as firmer fruit structure. The wine still needs time, so drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An amalgam of 85% Tannat, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Petit Verdot, this sports leather and blackberry aromas. The medium-bodied palate comes with tight, finely plaited tannins, and the boosted acids give the wine spine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Notes of potpourri, pepper, dark cherry and raspberry are well established and alluring. It has an open-feeling core, with buffed tannins and a juicy, textured finish. 80% Cabernet Franc, plus 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Tannat and 5% Petit Verdot.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark in color, the wine is meaty, dry and brambly in wild strawberry. It's easy to drink and like, with a smooth, hearty finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light in color it offers spicy, earthy overtones under thin layers of clove-wrapped cherry fruit and an easygoing texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light in color, aroma and flavor, it would be perfect when you want something simply fresh. It has cherry and cinnamon aromas, light raspberry and cherry cola flavors, and a light touch of tannin and acidity to balance the otherwise soft texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crafted from estate vineyards and a blend of Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec, this is a rosé rich in watermelon that's slightly effervescent and sweet, the finish speedy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas include underbrush, truffle, graphite and raw red cherry. These carry over to the palate along with strawberry, white pepper and mineral. It's elegant, with vigorous tannins and brisk acidity but it lacks fruit richness and body.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's lots of espresso, roasted coffee bean and toasted wood on the nose that carry over to the palate along with black plum and vanilla. But there's not enough fruit richness to stand up to the astringent wood tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This vintage of the winery's Sauvignon Blanc doesn't reflect the tropicality that's started to define the region. It has more warmth to the nose than the grassy pungency common elsewhere, but the stronger differences are on the palate, with cooked apple, squeezed lemon and a brisk acidity, though not a particularly long finish. Altogether, this is a mellow, subdued wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blackberry liqueur and char flavors are bolstered by mouth-coating tannins and plush acids. A stout wine, this craves to be paired with a platter of grilled meats.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An instantly enjoyable, balanced rosé. It's fresh, clean and full of red berry fruits, with a crisp finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With 70% Gamay in the blend, this attractive and fruity wine is dominated by bright cherry flavors and soft tannins. It is fresh with light acidity, a delicious summer red that would also work slightly chilled.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a bony, tight and herbaceous wine, sharp and crisp with bright apples and lime flavors. Light and full of minerality, it has a steely line that goes to its heart. Drink now, but it will be better in 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's something delicious about this wine, but it's not very Pinot Noir-like. Aromas of barbecue, bacon fat, smoked meats and strawberry carry through to the flavor profile, making it a perfect pairing for grilled ribs.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A medium-to full-bodied Pinot, it emphasizes full ripeness and rich texture. It looks slightly tawny in color on the rim of the glass, shows aromas of candied cherry, cola and fully developed fruit flavors. A dash of tartness keeps it alive on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pear juice, toast and macadamia nut aromas hit the nose first. The broad-shouldered palate offers integrated acids, which contribute to the plush mouthfeel. Hints of brown spice and lemon give the finish intrigue.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is initially soft and then begins to show a more steely, mineral character. That gives structure as well as citrus and crisp apple skin flavors. Very tight at this stage, it needs to develop, so give it until 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is a slight prickle on the tongue with this young wine. It's fruity and has some concentration from the 50-year-old vines. It's also totally dry and very crisp, with a delicious cut of acidity to partner that shellfish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It offers weight and richness as well a more nuanced herb and green fruit character. Depth of flavor shows ripeness, while a crisp, tight aftertaste suggests it could age.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This herbaceous wine is fresh, steely and crisp. Bright acidity cuts strongly through the lively texture, giving apples, lemon and pink grapefruit. Developing fast, it is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lean, green and mild, it's aromatically earthy and low on fruit. In the mouth, it's medium-bodied, with herbal, raspberry and red plum flavors. Peppery spice, a green note and raw heat drive the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While this is obviously Sauvignon Blanc, it also has some rich creaminess that makes it more rounded and rich. The citrus and crisp apple flavors are well-integrated into this ripe wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the winery's “mother block,” the oldest planting that dates back to 1999. Bright and spicy—perhaps a shade too bright—it hints at volatility. Raspberry and cherry fruit are matched with balanced tannins and a soft suggestion of clean earth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Easy-drinking and dry, it starts with pleasant strawberry and raspberry aromas that lead to moderately rich fruit flavors accented with white pepper. It doesn't feel as full-bodied as one might expect from Amador, and has an almost soft, silky finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This powerful wine opens with deep flavors and aromas of mint and dark chocolate. Its pleasure diminishes somewhat with an evolving taste of smoke and oak mid-sip that lasts subtly through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "White apricot, spice and lemon flavors give character. Vibrant acidity lends the plump palate satisfying energy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wet slate minerality leads the brisk, tightly wound nose. On the palate, the wine is a bit perfumed, at least for how tight the nose is, with elements of crisp apple, pear and a touch of nectarine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Medium to full in body, this has flavors of char, coffee and spiced dark cherries. It bears lax acids, and it finishes with a streak of clove.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Slightly funky scents of asphalt and sweaty socks come along with graphite, pressed blackberry and New Mexico chile. The palate is led by tobacco-laced zing, opening with boysenberry flavors, and finishing with decent acidity and mouth-coating tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a Merlot-based blend, tightly wound, with tart berry fruit flavors. It gathers and concentrates into a dense, fruit-laden finish, streaked with espresso and dark chocolate. Though labeled simply Yakima Valley, it's all Red Mountain fruit, mostly from Klipsun.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deep and rich aromas of blackberry syrup and wet slate kick off this excellent, approachable representation of Santa Barbara County's new Ballard Canyon appellation. It's both juicy and tannic once sipped, tasty with blackberry and slight cherry juice. Balanced with medium-range force, it provides evidence of how the region evens out Syrah's rougher edges.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Despite showing hickory and barbecued aromas of wood spice, smoked meat and stewed dark fruit, this Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend is firm and tight in the mouth, with smacking acidity. Herbal, lightly woody flavors of spice and earthy berry fruits finish bold, with olive and green tobacco notes. Drink through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very appealing aromas of warm strawberry-cherry pie, red licorice and red rose promise ripe juiciness in this nearly equal blend of Syrah and Mourvèdre. The palate delivers with cherry cola, and the wine almost seems sweet, yet is bone dry, with nice grippy tannins as well.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark berry, mineral and baked notes control the nose on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Petit Verdot and Syrah. This is full, round and firmly tannic, with oaky, minty flavors of black fruits and licorice root. Mocha, tobacco, chocolate and coffee flavors are nice on the finish. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Opulento is done entirely with Portuguese varieties. Quite young, grapey, rich and supple, it's packed with primary, brambly blackberry fruit with a smooth, chocolatey finish. This should age well for at least a decade.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Preserved cherries, cedar and smoke aromas lead the nose on this wine from the exciting Caliza team. The well-rounded flavors combine blackberry and cherry with tar and charred meats, and the strong tannins should calm down by 2016 and make for an even more delicious wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with a pretty fragrance of rose, vanilla, black fruit and subtle oak. The juicy palate offers red cherry, black raspberry, white pepper and a hint of cocoa alongside supple tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of violet and rose as well as notes of leather and spice waft from the glass. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, black raspberry, white pepper and savory herb alongside assertive tannins that still need years to unwind. Drink 2020–2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark, concentrated and powerful, this Carmenère-heavy blend pumps out huge cassis, blackberry and cola aromas in front of a racy, tannic, jet-powered palate. Baked, lemon-blackberry and cola flavors are earthy and forceful. Tobacco and cedar notes along with hard tannins push the finish. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This juicy, minerally blend is composed of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon and 22% Merlot. The winery aims to source from cool vineyard sites and this bottling is true to that in style—elegant and balanced, subtle in tannins and aged in only 50% new oak. Bay leaf and mint come to the fore ahead of clove.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of blackberry, cherry preserves, white chocolate and a hint of green pepper prepare the taste buds for flavors of forest-fruit, smoked pork, black pepper, violet and almond blossom. A trio of fruit, savory tones and spice travels across the palate on a layer of smooth tannins, leading to a smoky finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dense and full-bodied, this delivers sensations of asphalt, menthol, grilled herb, mature black cherry and game. Reflecting the heat of the vintage, it's ripe and forward but firmly knit tannins give it a solid backbone that will allow it to age for several more years.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A Spanish grape variety produced this temptingly smooth, polished but earthy-flavored wine. It smells like new leather, seems young and still leesy and tastes deliciously fruity and supple. A bit decadent, it carries a long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from 100% Demeter-certified biodynamic grapes, this wine has a bouquet of baked strawberry tart that makes it unique and full of personality. Amidst that is great peppery and earthy spice as well as a hint of dust, with a long-lasting finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The winery's larger-scale Syrah (and that's still under 2,000 cases), this is a friendly, sophisticated Rhône-inspired wine grown on the cooler Sonoma Coast. Red and blue fruits are expertly ripe and high-toned, accented by layers of classic cool-climate spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas recall blue flower, new leather, truffle and crushed raspberry. The bright palate offers wild cherry, cake spices, alpine herbs and a sprinkling of cocoa. It's well balanced and fresh with firm but fine tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A steely, crisp and mineral Riesling from the Froehn vineyard in Zellenberg. Great potential awaits in its tight aromatic fruits and zesty acidity. It offers structure, flavors of citrus and white currants from the organic grapes and a texture that demands aging. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The blend is 50% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 17% Cabernet Franc, aged in 100% new French oak. The only wine from this producer that is a blend, it currently shows an abundance of barrel flavors. The baking spices overpower some of the signature elements that this distinguished vineyard imparts—the mineral, saline, iron and steel notes often found in Ciel's red wines. The fruit remains gorgeously ripe, and with a bit more bottle age those subtle flavors may reappear.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Warm, slightly sweet aromas of smoked applewood and hickory waft from this rich and decadent Syrah sourced from the Fess Parker estate. On the dark fruit-laced palate are black currant and cherry cola flavors, bolstered by black licorice and followed by a long finish of vanilla cream.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crisp citrus aromas and fresh lemon and grapefruit flavors define this medium-bodied, appetizing and unapologetic wine. With lots of personality, a tingly texture and tangy finish, it's just the thing for appetizers and first courses.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Reserva version of Mural makes a powerful statement. Dark in color and packed with concentrated fruit, it is full of tannins as well as brooding black-plum flavors. Spice and juicy acidity complete the ensemble. It's a solid wine that needs to age to soften the tannic structure. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is a fine exposition of the structure and density of a serious Douro wine. A field blend, it is packed with dark berry fruits and sweet tannins, with a strong mineral element that reflects the tough schist of the vineyards. It's drinkable now, but the wine will be better in 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Coming in at 12.8% alcohol—nearly unheard of for a Washington red, particularly in a warm vintage—it brings appealing notes of dark plum accented by black pepper and dried herbs. It's silky soft in feel with a dazzling sense of texture and purity with little apparent oak influence.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy, ripe and a touch mulchy smelling at first, this blend comes around to show full plum and berry scents. The palate is bulky—a reflection of a warm vintage. Ripe berry notes house chocolate and fig flavors, with a touch salt finishing it off. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This was the first release from this new, Chardonnay-only project. With its mix of Columbia Gorge, Ancient Lakes and Columbia Valley fruit, it immediately set a high standard. Scents of orange blossom, mineral oil and toasted pecan mingle gracefully, and in the mouth there is a steely edge that provides structural support. Drink now through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Attractive tobacco, cedar, graphite, coconut and blackberry aromas are an ideal invitation to this balanced, full-bodied blend of Malbec, Carmenère, Cabernet Franc and Syrah. Flavors of blackberry, mocha, fig paste, spice and chocolate finish dark, ripe and slightly soft. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This savory GSM blend, which gets tiny 3% boosts of Petite Sirah and Tempranillo, begins with aromas of chicory coffee, ginger and a bit of blackberry fruit. Black cherry fruit leads the flavor, with espresso and tar elements contributing to noticeable tannic grip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mint, anisette and red berry aromas lead the nose. These follow through to the palate along with licorice, espresso, coffee, toasted oak and black pepper. It's tightly framed with drying wood tannins, but the bright fruit stands up to the strong oak influence. Drink after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While honey and white peach flavors ring pure and sweet, there's a slatey, mineral tone that penetrates deeply in this off-dry Kabinett. It's nervy and brisk, finishing long with zesty lime pith bitterness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full in the mouth, this rich wine is dominated by yellow fruits and ripe apricots lifted by a touch of toast. Great acidity conveys a fresh and tangy character. The wine is still developing as the full fruitiness comes forward. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose is initially rather closed but eventually reveals baked earth, leather, game and ripe black fruit. The taut, tense palate offers dried black cherry, toasted oak, mocha and vanilla alongside grainy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fragrant and bright, this offers aromas of rose, iris, perfumed berry and a balsamic note. The palate is still rather closed, offering raw red cherry, star anise and chopped sage alongside tightly knit tannins and brisk acidity. It still needs time to come together. Drink 2018–2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From vines planted in 1958 in an appellation that straddles both Sonoma and Mendocino counties, this is an intriguing, interesting wine, mostly varietal, with 8% each of Mourvèdre and Syrah. Floral, it veers into leather and game, with a juicy backbone of red cherry and berry and earthy, textured tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A velvety, sinewy blend of 40% Syrah, 40% Grenache and 20% Mourvèdre from estate-grown and nearby vineyards, this wine offers a lot to like, from textured tannins to succulent blueberry and plum. Intense and floral, it finishes with an explosion of white pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rose, red berry, mint and anise aromas unfold in the glass. The firm palate offers wild cherry, crushed raspberry, clove, anisette and a mocha note framed in bracing tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2020–2031.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Brioche and vanilla-cherry are the stars in this full-bodied yet savory, herbal wine sourced mostly from the Oak Knoll District. Complex in flavor, it spikes in clove and cinnamon, finishing with a taste of gunpowder and tobacco.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offers aromas of toast, espresso, scorched earth, red berry, clove and a whiff of leather. The lean, tense palate offers dried cherry, grilled herb, anise, coffee and tobacco but not much fruit richness. Tightly wound, bracing tannins and nervous acidity provide the framework.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a fourth-generation farming family, this wine is sourced from the Niebaum-Tonella and Morisoli-Borges vineyards along the Rutherford Bench. It opens with a bouquet of sweetly ripened mango, peach and pear, which continue on the palate. Fierce acidity and a drop of anise form the backdrop of the wine, which finishes somewhat tropical.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This dense and dark wine offers spice and toast flavors. It has a big, generous feel, leaving room both for the dry, still-young tannins and for aromatic blackberry fruits. It does need to age, so drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Enticing aromas of red rose, wild red berry and aromatic herb lead the way. The palate offers dried berry, grilled herb, mocha and toast alongside assertive tannins and nervous acidity. Give this a few years for the tannins to unfold. Drink after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Leafy underbrush, truffle, woodland berry and toast aromas lead the nose. The chewy, solid palate offers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, grilled sage and ground aniseed alongside bracing tannins and assertive acidity. Drink 2018–2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of mature berry, menthol, coffee bean, toast and dark cooking spice emerge on this bracing wine. The firmly structured palate delivers dried black cherry, espresso, French oak, licorice, chopped herb and tobacco set against bracing, close-grained tannins and the warmth of alcohol. The tannins will need years to unwind.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Showing the heat of the vintage, this offers earthy sensations of leather, scorched soil, truffle, stewed prune and ripe cherry. Bracing tannins provide the backdrop.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Based in Clare Valley, Wakefield sources this fruit from the cooler Adelaide Hills. Attractive rose-petal and dry earth aromas lead the way, followed by notes of black cherries and licorice on the palate. It's a bit full-bodied and muscular, a Pinot more for steak than salmon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with aromas of ripe berry, aromatic herb, pressed rose petal and a balsamic note. The rather lean palate offers sour cherry, crushed strawberry, sage and star anise alongside nervous acidity and tightly wound, astringent tannins that leave a rather raspy finish. Give this a few more years to unclench. Drink after 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Old-vine fruit delivers an elegant Pinot that combines low alcohol with graceful details of pretty spices and red fruits. Young, tangy cherry flavors are precisely defined, with a delicate tension. This might very well improve dramatically with a decade or more of cellaring. Drink 2020–2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wood-aged, fortified Moscatel has retained its fruitiness while also showing older, wood and toast flavors. Perfumed and fragrant, with integrated acidity, enjoy this offering soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Firm and polished, this barrel-fermented wine is just rounded off enough, without damping the bright, almost crunchy fruit. There's a light touch of toast and the structure for further bottle age to improve it. Drink 2017–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark ruby in the glass, this wine has a nose of lingonberry and pomegranate with a hint of pine needles. It offers well-integrated fruit and cooling herb flavors, notably blueberry, cherry, mint, tarragon, and fennel. Ultimately fruit reigns over coolness on the velvety finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Perfumed berry, iris and baking spice aromas float out of the glass. The firm palate offers mature wild cherry, ripe raspberry, licorice, menthol and chopped herb while assertive but refined tannins provide support.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full bodied, this estate-made, 100% varietal wine is sinewy and dense, a combination of ripe, luscious blackberry and blueberry, akin to a compote, seasoned in lavender and black licorice. Weighty, it'll pair well with wintertime meals, finishing with a suggestion of vanilla bean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 50-50 blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon shows dried strawberries, violets, lilacs, chocolate sauce and cappuccino on the nose. The palate offers dark chocolate, strawberry and cherry flavors, along with a leveling effect from pencil lead and graphite. Watch for a future in this sort of blend from the Central Coast.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In keeping with the style of dessert wine in this region, this wine is beautifully balanced between acidity and intense sweetness. Together they give a wine that is so fresh, packed with a crisp texture as well as ripe apricot and white peach flavors that are just touched by honey. Drink now for its freshness, although it will be even better if aged until 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "Although red cherry and raspberry make an appearance, this vineyard-designate is otherwise all about forested pine and earthy pungency, accented by a pretty floral tease of rose petal. High in acidity and tannin, it takes time in the glass to settle down and find its balance, with a lengthy finish of black licorice and clove.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine offers a bouquet of baking bread with a touch of lemon curd. It presents a sophisticated palate of lemon, lime, orange blossom, piecrust, and eucalyptus. It has pleasing acidity that overcomes cooling herb flavors on the finish, and while it is light in the mouth, soft tannins persist on the gum line for a short while after swallowing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Silky succulent raspberry and cherry flavors are a luscious counterpoint to the razor's edge of acidity that frames this impeccably balanced wine. It's ripe, fruity and forward, yet offers surprising elegance and length. Drink now through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Layers of pollen, dusty mineral and spice lend complexity to this concentrated wine full of yellow peach and fresh apple flavors. It's delicate and lithe in texture, yet punchy and penetrating.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Inky, rich and dense, this wine has an abundance of red and black berry pie going on that makes it decadently inviting. Thick on the palate, it's ready to pair with saucy cuts of meat, its background note of smoke the ideal way to bring out charred flavors in a food.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Beautiful crushed red cherry and lifted, polished mahogany notions mark the nose of this wine. The palate has wonderfully balanced freshness; its red cherry flavors are ripe but crunchy with a fine, firm structure for support. This has elegance, poise and delicious freshness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark, brooding blueberry scents permeate this light-bodied red on the nose and palate. Fresh and tinged with white pepper spice, it boasts tart, crunchy fruit and ample depth despite the coolness of the vintage. Those who love reds with tension will fall in love. Drink now–2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% varietal wine shines with high-toned red currant and raspberry flavors, exhibiting bright acidity on the moderately built palate. Tight-grained tannin provides structure, balancing the emphatic fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dense mossy aromas of blackberry are slightly murky. Forget about delicacy on the palate, this is full-bodied and clattering. Blackberry, cassis, black cherry and chocolate flavors finish spicy. This is at maximum ripeness. Drink through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Felton Road's blended bottling continues to impress. In this vintage, it reveals faintly herbal and peppery aromas layered against raspberry and blueberry fruit. It's medium to full in body, but with supple tannins that caress the palate on their way to a lingering, spicy finish. Drink now–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Strong classy oak aromas lead blackberry and baking-spice scents on a potent but textbook RDD nose. This old-vines wine from a benchmark year is tight-fisted and linear in feel, with lemony acidity. Fully oaked flavors of blackberry and cassis sit comfortably on a bed of herb and spice notes, while this is oaky, spicy, steady and integrated on the finish. Drink through 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mike Sinor's pet-nat experiment scored big in 2016. This pink sparkler offers complex yeasty bread, crushed rock and turned clay aromas. Zingy and racy, it grabs hold of the palate. It's all about fascinating texture and refreshing acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wonderfully floral, brooding oak notes frame this inviting Sankt Laurent's red cherry fruit. On the palate, the oak comes across as vanilla, enwrapping the cherry fruit with richness. This is light on its feet but ripe and elegant with wonderful, lasting freshness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bottling, which is both a reference to the Lynyrd Skynyrd song and an ode to the grape growers, offers vibrant blackberry, slate and vanilla aromas. The palate is ripe and juicy but balanced, with tangy plum skin and dark spice flavors, framed by a chalky tannic structure. It's fruity enough for traditional California Zinfandel fans but complex enough to win converts.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark and sappy, with earth-driven complexity, this includes as many as 15 different clones planted on the far western edge of the AVA. Savory flavors bring black cherry, cola, smoke, and an underpinning of earth and black tea.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spicy earthy briary aromas include a note of cola along with requisite berry and cassis scents. A slightly choppy mouthfeel and flavors of blueberry, cardamom, herbs and oak define the palate, while this finishes fruity and open. Drink through 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Palliser's top-of-the-line Pinot is named after a different loved companion-dog every year. This is a nearly full-bodied wine, a bit chunky and muscular in style, with cherry and plum fruit and savory overtones beetroot and greens. the finish is long and richly textured, suggesting a reasonable lifespan. Drink 2020–2025+.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dense aromas of fig, prune, cassis and blackberry are more mellow than monstrous. In the mouth, this Cabernet feels chunky, ripe and fully tannic. Savory berry fruit flavors and notes of cured meats and jerky finish a bit flat, with a lasting flavor of oaky chocolate. Drink through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Scoring slightly higher than the Alderpoint vineyard-designated wine, this basic Humboldt County bottling bursts with with black cherry aroma. It's medium-bodied, free of oak-driven flavor and loaded with fruit. Lively acidity and mouth-filling texture keep the cherry and raspberry notes echoing through the finish, striking wonderful balance in an appetizing, mouthwatering package.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The lovely, pure citrus hints suggested on the nose are fulfilled on the palate: aromatic tangerine peel and vivid, ripe Amalfi lemon. This has such lightness, ease and quintessential Wachau verve that you can't help going in for more. The finish is dry and irresistibly long.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This rich, dark take on the cool-climate vineyard delivers all the great Syrah components. Lavish cooked beef, fudge, loam and mint aromas accent its black currant and blueberry base. The palate is coated with soft, polished tannins that present savory beef and black currant flavors, steeped in peppercorn and lavender.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Malbec makes up just under two-thirds of this wine, with the balance Syrah. Quite pure fruit-forward aromas of blue fruit, herb and clove lead to a sweet plush rich palate that shows good midpalate density. The finish lingers.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a wine that showcases the Mourvèdre grape (80% of the blend). That gives a wonderful perfumed wine, bringing out fine tannins and a rich structure. Aged in wood for 20 months, the wine has a spicy edge to balance the ripe black-plum flavors. It is only just ready to drink and will be much better from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spicy clove flavors enwrap rounded tannin and integrated oak in this structured, bold and full-bodied wine. A reserve-tier bottling, it shows deep red fruit, from cassis to currant, and a predominance of both the savory and tart.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Named after the year the estate was first recorded, this is a rich wood-aged wine. It has spice, stern tannins and layers of black currants and black plums that still need to have their head. The wine is dry as well as firm but will open up and soften to give a sumptuous wine from 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fermented in oak, this is the second wine from the estate. It has much of the fine concentration, the richness and the dark chocolate and black-fruit flavors of the first wine, just with a softer hue. It is likely to develop relatively quickly and generously. Drink from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the top wine from the Jean-Pierre Fayard family Provence cru classé estate. It is full of ripe red fruits supported by a mineral texture. The wine is generous, bone dry but packed with great fruitiness and finished with refreshing acidity. This sophisticated wine could do with a few more months, so drink from late 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe orchard fruit, acacia, Spanish broom and citrus aromas lead the nose of this wine. On the enveloping, structured palate, a honeyed mineral note adds depth to mature pear, lemon drop and hazelnut flavors. Fresh acidity lends balance. It's an amazing achievement for the cool, wet vintage.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of crushed violets, dried herb, smoked meat and plum lead to focused, pure marionberry flavors. The concentration and texture are impressive, as is the balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy berry scents and charred aromas of grilled steak include notes of wood spice and vanilla. On the palate, this is deep, and shows a good mix of bright acidity and meaty depth. Flavors of toasty oak, chocolate, blackberry and pepper finish with persistent chocolaty notes and intense acidity. Drink through 2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pinot Noir specialist Bryan Babcock explores this aromatic white grape, delivering a lush and creamy expression. Poached pear and orange blossom notes combine with a nutty quality on the nose, while the wine's creamy consistency meets buoyant acidity on the palate. Lush apple, pear and cashews flavors complete the picture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a vineyard planted above the town of Sonoma and named for its address, this small-production wine offers blueberry pie, chocolate and smoky oak aromas. Big and burly on the palate with sizable tannins, it integrates black cherry and burnt orange into the mix, finishing balanced and elegant.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This small-production blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Merlot from winemaker Tom Rinaldi is rounded and juicy, with moderate acidity. It shows generous clove, cinnamon and black cherry flavors, the structure supportive and graceful.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This densely textured, deeply flavored wine showcases the beauty of old vines in Amador terroir. It has an opaque color, opulent clove, blackberry and cassis aromas, and ripe, jammy flavors that drench the palate yet are supported by tannins firm enough to keep it balanced and appetizing. Best after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The historic Santa Cruz Island Zinfandel clone excels more at the Rusacks' Ballard Canyon estate than their Catalina Island vineyard. Deep strawberry and red plum aromas mesh with cinnamon, mace and a touch of earth on the nose. There's enough tannic grip to show elegance, with bright red fruit and hearty sagebrush spice flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bruised apple and dandelion notes play spicily on the textured, slightly phenolic palate. The central streak of freshness brightens all aspects of the wine, which might gain complexity with a year or two more in bottle. For now it remains intriguingly poised between earthy richness and ethereal lift.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Minty cedar and red raspberry jam provide a freshness to this medium-built wine, subtle in spice and made in a soft, approachable style. Cherry and cinnamon round out the lengthy finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A handful of Cabernet Franc is included in this wine, which is full-bodied and quite robust, indicative of its mountain birth. While violet and rose florals accent dark cherry tastes, the tannin weight hints at meaty and spicy undertones.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aged for a year on its lees, this wine is rich, tangy and refreshingly crisp. It is a Blanc de Blancs, with a strongly mineral character that adds a tight character to the texture. It will age a few more months in bottle, so drink from late 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "On the basis that anything goes with rosé, this wine is 100-percent Sangiovese, known locally as Niellucciu. The acidity that is typical of the grape is very present as are red cherry and tight fruit flavors. It is so crisp and lively, bouncing from the glass and leaving a beautiful array of red fruits at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Scents of pressed white flower, orchard fruit, smoke, citrus and a whiff of nut lead the nose on this savory white. The round, medium-bodied palate offers mature pear, pineapple, peach and hazelnut while a note of flinty mineral lifts the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Heady aromas of citrus and orchard fruit almost jump out of the glass. The savory, medium-bodied palate tastes of ripe pear, mature apple and creamy peach interspersed with energizing mineral notes. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Whiffs of cedar and baking spices lead to ripe blackberry and boysenberry flavors in this well-balanced and easy to appreciate wine. The ample fruit flavors are hard to resist, and the supple, modestly tannic texture is just right.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blossoms and pink grapefruits scent this fresh, fruity wine. Off dry in style, it's concentrated in plush, tropical flavors of guava and mango yet calibrated neatly by a vein of lime acidity. It's guzzably fresh and approachable but refined enough for elegant dining occasions. Drink now through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is ripe, rich and even a touch tannic—almost more of a light red than a true rosé. This makes it ideally suited to serve alongside summer's various grilled meats. Raspberry and cola flavors finish spicy and round.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with alluring aromas of raspberry jam, blue flower, ground pepper and grilled herb. The savory, succulent palate offers juicy black cherry, black raspberry, clove and mineral. Firm tannins provide seamless support while fresh acidity lifts the ripe, mouthwatering fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full-flavored and very crisp, this wine has bright citrus and melon aromas, and more mellow pear and fig flavors that seem to smooth out the texture with each sip. It's well balanced and fascinating to taste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Alluring scents of spring blossom, Spanish broom, crushed stone and ripe orchard fruit meld together in the glass. The medium-bodied palate is a bit rounder and juicer than previous vintages although it still retains elegance, offering white peach, green apple and juicy lemon drop alongside energizing mineral. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The King Estate name is intentionally printed upside down on the label, emphasizing the paradoxical nature of the wine, which has been barrel aged. As when oak is applied to Pinot Gris, it mutes the varietal nuances of the grape. So along with tart apple and pear fruit, you'll find a softer palate, with vanilla and buttered nuts in the aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the producer's inaugural foray into the variety, sourced from the Oak Knoll area. The wine is inspired by the Loire Valley and its well-known Cabernet Franc. Coopered in French oak and stainless steel, it retains a subtle crispness and light body, the acidity supporting highlights of floral white fig, pear and honey.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blistered red plum, savory herbs, black olive and a touch of green peppercorn show on the nose of this blend of 69% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Petit Verdot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot. Pencil lead and black peppercorns come through on the palate, spicing up the black-cherry, clay-earth and roasted-coffee flavors. It goes down easy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh cherry and berry aromas are easy to process and appealing. This has a full body that doesn't require much thought, while a lightly candied, peachy flavor profile ends in friendly, healthy fashion.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine brings spicy cranberry and strawberry, underscored with a whiff of leather. Flavors punch down and finish strong, with a leathery note that does not preclude the solid fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tart, young and focused, this brings cranberry and black cherry fruit forward, with a lively, spicy mouthfeel. Flavors are battened down with bracing acidity and firm tannins. Give this an hour or more of breathing time, or decant.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Returning to a robust, forward style in 2014, this is loaded with black cherry and mocha flavors. There's a touch of charred wood, and alcohol approaching 15%—this is no wimpy wine. It spent 11 months in 40% new wood.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Vibrant and savory, this linear white offers scents of ripe orchard fruit, white flower and a whiff of spice. The juicy palate doles out pear, apple, nectarine and mineral along with a note of ginger.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Stalky, gritty aromas of olive, eucalyptus and berry fruits are 100% Chilean. This feels big, wide and tannic. Flavors of roasted berry fruits are stalky and herbal, while this finishes with peppery, herbal overtones and gritty, chewy tannins. Drink through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lighter bramble and red-currant fruits pop on the nose of this wine from the appellation's eastern end, as do baking-spice notes, crushed vanilla and hibiscus. It's airy on the palate, with tense cranberry and pomegranate, crushed oregano and dill, pencil lead minerality and a slowly simmering acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is fruity and ripe, forward and round, with appealing tropical fruit flavors. There's moderate, but adequate, acidity, and the flavors are rounded off with a toasty note from aging 10 months in 30% new French oak. Drink this now through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Vibrant and elegant, this offers aromas of wild flower and ripe red berry. The juicy palate doles out tart red cherry, fresh strawberry and mineral alongside tangy acidity. A mouthwatering saline note closes the bright finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Juicy bursts of ripe blackberry and blueberry are reined in by a firm backbone of acidity and cool herbal swathes in this full-bodied Lemberger. Just softly fringed by tannins, it's an approachable but sophisticated wine to enjoy now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bracing and tangy, this light-bodied wine has distinct melon aromas, similar flavors and tasty accents of white pepper and fresh fennel. While nicely reserved it also has complexity and great balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy plum and raspberry aromas are subtle. This is tight on the palate, with firm tannins and slightly elevated acidity. Earthy, lightly toasted raspberry and plum flavors finish dry. As a whole, this is well made and exceeds expectations.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is deliberately picked early to preserve acidity and aging potential. At nine years of age, the result is a wine that's just beginning to mature yet remains youthful, with bright lemon notes and a long, dry finish. If you prefer additional richness, hold until at least 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Grapy aromas seem simple at first, but with time tarry black plum and citrus peel notes emerge. This is very tannic, arguably a bit too much so. Plum, blackberry and chocolate flavors end with a reverb of hard tannins. For best results, give this as much air as possible.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Extremely ripe and concentrated, this opens with aromas that suggest charred earth, toast, cured meat and roasted coffee bean. The accessible, monolithic palate offers raspberry jam, chocolate-covered cherry and a hint of vanilla alongside mature tannins, with the warmth of evident alcohol.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Grapefruit and other citrus flavors dominate this wine. Grown on chalk soil, it is structured and nervy, with a steely texture that promises some aging. Fresh and brilliant in its lively acidity, it is ready to drink now until 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deep pink and nearing mauve in color, this juicy blush shows watermelon Jolly Rancher candy, warm strawberry, and lemon butter on the nose. The mouthfeel is soft and voluptuous, with lime-laced pomegranate fruit, a touch of brown spice and a consistent acidic sizzle that rides the whole sip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Commemorating the small boats that once plied the Loire river, this wine is fresh with a ripe yellow-fruit character that contrasts with the salty, tangy flavors to give the wine its texture and tight, steely structure. The wine will be best kept for a few months; drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Densely concentrated, this opens with aromas of baked plum, vanilla, espresso, oak and fresh mushroom. The robust, extremely ripe palate doles out stewed prune, blackberry jam and licorice while firm, close-grained tannins provide support.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bursts of pink grapefruit and peach brighten this light-footed semidry Riesling. It's mouthwatering and juicy, intensified by streaks of lemon-lime acidity that extend a lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lush in winemaker Brian Loring's preferred style, this wine shows roasted cashews, seared lemons and baked apples on the nose. There's a walnut-oil quality to the palate, which is chewy and fat but not overreaching, with touches of tonic, cinnamon and caramel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The flint soil behind this wine gives it a stony, smoky character that is allied to the mineral texture. It's a ripe wine, still young with pure fruit and an intense acidity. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With some wood aging, this limited-production wine comes from 45-year-old vines. It balances the lightly spicy wood flavors with crisp citrus fruits. The wine is still young, still fully integrating and will be much better from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bottling, which is leveled a bit by the inclusion of 13% Zinfandel and 12% Grenache, shows blackberry jam, black cherry and concentrated lilac aromas on the nose. The palate is nicely layered with just enough tannic structure for optimal drinking now, combining flavors of blueberry and black cherry with caramel, milk chocolate and plum-skin tartness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 39% Merlot, 20% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec shows umami-driven notes of beef char and campfire on the fairly tight nose, along with condensed violets and black cherry. Grippy tannins contain the palate, where layers of herbs, black fruits, asphalt, roast-beef char and blueberry pie show strongly.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% Vranec presents the nose with black plum, blackberry, tobacco leaf and saddle leather and the palate with blueberry, dried herbs, tobacco and red plums. The finish is soft and elegant.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is muted and still youthful, a blend of mostly Cabernet with 13% Merlot, 7% Syrah, 3% Petite Sirah and 1% Cabernet Franc. Pencil lead and dust fight for attention around big, bittersweet tannin and tobacco, not sure whether or not to let the black currant and cassis shine through.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of toast, oak, coconut, vanilla, mocha and mature plum lead the nose. Oak-driven sensations drive the robust palate along with ripe berry and a confectionary note. Scorching alcohol dominates the finish and throws this off-balance while bracing tannins leave an astringent close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas that recall charred earth, toast, oak, black plum, baking spice and espresso meld together on this. The generous, chewy palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, black raspberry, vanilla and mocha alongside supple tannins. It's straightforward, with immediate appeal. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright aromas of apricot, pear, botrytis and jasmine are followed by medium-sweet stone-fruit flavors, backed by vibrant acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Merlot and 20% Mavrud has aromas of dried cranberries and ripe red raspberry. It is full bodied in the mouth with flavors of ripe black plum and pleasantly chewy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Forward berry aromas are more clean and fresh than complex. On the palate, this is similar, with bold, freshening acidity. Flavorwise, this leans into the black-fruit spectrum, while mint, spice and peppery flavors grace the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spiced cherry and berry aromas are common but good. A bright, acidic palate feels perfectly healthy and lively, while flavors of plum and berry fruits get a dusting of dry spice. A slow-driving finish offers a steady ending.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose is rather closed on this 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot blend but it eventually reveals whiffs of prune and leather. The evolved, dense palate is more expressive, offering blackberry jam, licorice and black pepper alongside round tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit and freshness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoothly voluptuous, this is a blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon with 20% Zinfandel, 10% Syrah and 5% Merlot. Leather, red fruit, cigar and syrup combine to full-bodied effect, ending in a thickness of structure and power.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of high-toned cocoa, vanilla, coconut, pencil lead and baking spices lead to plentiful black fruit flavors, with a lick of grainy tannins backing them up. The barrel notes get out front at times but it still provides a lot of quality and value.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big and chewy, this starts with aromas of grilled porcini, underbrush, ripe dark fruit, dried herb and clove. Tightly packed tannins frame dried black cherry, prune steeped in spirits, ground pepper and licorice. You'll also feel the heat of evident alcohol on the midpalate that throws it somewhat off-balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plum, vanilla, sunbaked earth and espresso aromas take shape in the glass. The structured palate offers dried red cherry, roasted coffee bean and vanilla alongside fine-grained tannins that clutch the finish.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "This deep garnet Kosher blend of 55% Rubin and 45% Merlot is scented with black plum, blackberry and freshly ground black pepper. It flavors are those of dried cranberries and tart cherry. It has balanced tannins with a pleasantly tart finish.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Syrah takes the lead on this blend followed by a healthy dose of Mourvèdre. It's the latter that is initially evident, with generous white-pepper and meaty aromas followed by fresh flowers, raspberries and a touch of coffee. The red- and blue-fruit flavors show a fine sense of balance, with plenty of hang time on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The raspberry aromas are bright and jammy. The flavors are sumptuous yet elegant, going down easy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Effectively half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this is a tremendous wine. With very fine tannins, spice from a touch of wood and swathes of ripe fruits give this wine its concentration and its huge potential. The wine has weight and a dark, dense structure that will allow it to age for many years. Drink from 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Marked by both reduction and oak, this wine feels lifted with acidity, opening in a vibrant shock of strawberry and Mandarin orange. Velvety layers subtle tannin carry a spicy finish of clove and salty sea air. A beautifully balanced, complete wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an immensely dense wine that is going to be a classic. The dark tannins are still lined with wood aging but that will go because the fruit underneath is also just as dense and intense. Blackberry, black plum and damson plum give power and sweetness. This is a great wine with huge potential. Drink from 2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The classic blend for Figeac with its 32% of Cabernet Sauvignon and 28% Cabernet Franc gives a beautifully dense wine with great tannins. The wine is perfumed while the complex tannins are finely cushioned by the generous black fruits and acidity. It is a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With 83% Sémillon in the blend, this wine has weight as well as richness. At the same time, it has a crisp edge, a smoky character from wood aging and the fine balance between citrus and more exotic fruits. It is a wine to age for many years. Drink from 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a major wine. It has enormous tension, structure and a core of dark tannins. Amid all this, the wine is also packed with fruit and concentrated blackberry and black-plum flavors. It will age slowly and steadily with its enormous structure and concentration. Drink this wine from 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With the amalgamation of Château Magdelaine into this one property, the estate is now a considerable 58 acres. The wine is now performing in top gear. Powerful tannins drive the mainly Merlot blend with 10% Cabernet Franc. It still shows signs of the wood aging and these will disappear to leave a richly endowed wine with a fine future. Drink from 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The label of this vintage is designed by David Hockney in memory of Philippine de Rothschild. It is a powerful wine in the rich style of Mouton with strong black-currant fruits from 81% Cabernet Sauvignon. It is dense and dark, ready to age for many years.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine from Jordan Fiorentini is a stunning study in how to achieve extreme richness with elegance. Deep black cherry, violet, espresso, milk chocolate and vanilla pastry show on the nose. On the palate, chalky, soft tannins bring forth baked blueberry, star anise and clove flavors, with floral tones and acidic lift on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is possibly the most savory rendition of Syrah made on the Central Coast, each vintage as feral as the last. This bottling shows bloody lamb, crushed peppercorn, soy and barnyard elements on the nose. The palate is tense with tarry structure, revealing unusual kelp, stewed peppercorn, black miso and teriyaki flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With its high proportion of Cabernet Franc (45%), this is a finely perfumed rich wine. It has great tannins, a smoky character that comes from the wood. The tannins are quite marked, giving a tight firm edge to the wine that otherwise has generous fruitiness. This is a complex wine, impressive, and likely to age over many years. Drink from 2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An extra dollop of toasty oak amplifies the deep black-cherry core. Cedar, pipe tobacco, espresso and dark chocolate highlights wrap around and through the finish. This is a wine with power, precision and exceptional detail. Drink now through the mid-2020s.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A best-of blend from several of the producer's vineyard sites, this wine explodes in flavor and complexity as though celebrating each site's individual beauty and potential. Black pepper and crisp orange and pomegranate flavors show through its layered and focused texture—a savory package with a seemingly endless finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a powerful wine, made to age for a long time, from this estate which is performing in top gear. Complex tannins and dark fruits both make their presence felt. It has weight, ripeness and a dense structure. A great success, it is unlikely to be ready to drink before 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "What to mention first? A hint of mossy earth, chamomile tisane, Cox Orange Pippin apples or lemon zest? All of these aromas dance on the nose. They are still totally shy on the taut, dry and concentrated palate. For now, it is mossy citrus that is most aromatic while rich fruit still needs to unfurl. This strikes a note of utter purity, of something soaring and bright. Right now this is totally brisk, invigorating and refreshing but its true colors won't show for some time. Drink 2020–2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Somehow, in a stellar 2014 lineup, this vineyard designate stands out, as the 2012 did when it was the Wine Enthusiast 2015 wine of the year. Power and precision work in tandem here. The fruit blend conjures up melon, berry, cherry and more, and the oak has the gentlest touch to its presence. There's tremendous midpalate concentration, and the clear sense that this could age for decades. Let's just say drink 2018 through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This powerful wine has a superb mix of the crispest fruit and great structure. Blackberries and black currants shine through the tannins, expressing the liveliness of the vintage. It is so well delineated with everything in its place. The wine is certainly going to age for decades. Drink from 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here's an impressive wine that is so ripe and with great structure. It is a major wine with a dark complex texture and the finest acidity. The wine is very complete, all the elements in place from the black fruits to the tannins to the hints of wood aging. Now at the top of the tree in Saint-Emilion's classification, the wine will take years to mature. Drink from 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A fragrant and pure nose of slightly floral tangerine peel opens this wine. It offers a ripe fruit-driven dance of aromas and freshness—think tangerine, ripe lemon, crisp apple and a beguiling floral dimension. Lovely now in its primary-flavored youth, it's certain to become even more disarming in the future. Drink 2020–2035 or later if you like it really mature.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Enticing perfumed berry, violet, new leather and a truffle scents emerge in this textbook Brunello. On the savory, full-bodied palate, licorice, clove and chopped herb flavors accent a juicy core of ripe black cherry fruit. Firm, refined tannins provide structure. It's already tempting but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2020–2032.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Underbrush, ripe berry, new leather and Mediterranean herb aromas slowly take shape in the glass. Showing youthful tension, the vibrant palate delivers red cherry, pomegranate, white pepper and pipe tobacco notes framed by bright acidity and taut, refined tannins. It already shows great balance and finesse but is still young and tight. Drink 2022–2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This almost 100% Cabernet Franc single-vineyard wine is perfumed and ripe. The velvet tannins and ripe black fruits are fine, structured and with enormous potential. The wine is generous, opulent and worthy of serious aging. Drink from 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh and full of finesse, this radiant red offers rose, forest floor, woodland berry, new leather and pipe tobacco scents. The palate delivers juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, wild herb and white pepper notes, finishing on star anise. Taut, refined tannins and bright acidity give it intensity, lift and balance. Give it time to develop to its full potential. Drink 2020–2032.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This single-vineyard Carignan is living proof of how impressive the variety can be, especially when hailing from a top year like 2012. Schisty aromas of blackberry, chocolate and mocha are smooth and alluring. This feels focused, pure and juicy, while dense blackberry, mocha and baking spice flavors tail off with exotic notes of Malabar pepper, toast and the finest black coffee. Drink through 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a finely structured wine with dark tannins and intense black fruits. The estate, with its biodynamically grown fruit, has given an impressively pure wine, packed with tight serious tannins and a fine structure of black-plum skins and intense acidity. It is direct, firm and with a huge potential over many years. Drink from 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This riveting wine displays the exceptional finesse and precision that fruit from this AVA can deliver. It's Pinot Noir expressed in the most subtle and demanding way. Beautifully orchestrated red fruits, sappy acids, lush spices, perfect balance and an immaculate mineral-soaked finish are all on display. Drink 2018 through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Barley sugar, butterscotch, demerara sugar and the faintest hint of maple syrup suggest the richness of this SGN right away. The concentrated sweetness is countered with illuminating freshness and holds tons of tangy spice. Wow. This is incredibly concentrated and has an elixir-like bundled energy that seems to be alive. The effect is both mesmerizing and invigorating.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine shows a high degree of spiciness with a rose petal-like flourish—a stellar first effort from a new estate vineyard along Eastside Road. Brambly raspberry and dark cherry flavors seem brushed by a subtle waft of campfire smoke and molten chocolate, all swirling together in the glass as a lengthy, lively palate framed by acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a top example of the classic Australian blend. Cabernet (57%) provides cigar box aromas and elongates the finish, while Shiraz (43%) fills out the midpalate. The combination is full-bodied yet muscular, generous yet firmly structured. Essence of cassis is framed by hints of vanilla and cedar, while the long finish shows off chewy tannins and mouthwatering acids. Drink 2023–2035, and posssibly beyond.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A tightly coiled rich wine that has great acidity as well as a lively structure. Touched by spice from wood aging as well as intense citrus, it is fruity, firm and strongly textured. Drink this impressive still-young wine from 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is fruity, fresh with a underlying tannic character. The fruit and the dryness combine to produce a wine that is firm while rich, showing juicy Merlot and some medium-term potential. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Layers of new wood show through as a perfumed, minty character. Tannins are firm and dry over the juicy black fruits. The wine is light, fresh and balanced, ready to drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While sun-ripened apricot and wildflowers aromas abound on the nose of this dry Riesling, the palate is more mineral and restrained. Lemon-lime acidity is zesty and fresh, leading to a brisk, biting finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Already the color of this 2011 Merlot-dominated wine is beginning to change from its brilliant red. The palate also shows signs of maturing with fresh fruit giving way to more leathery, spicy flavors. That suggest this will not age long, so drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hushed aromas of dark berry and a touch of cedar lead the nose on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. The simple palate offers black cherry and a hint of white pepper alongside delicate, fleeting tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "IFragrant with sweet vanilla and nutmeg from new oak, this has a very full body and velvety texture. All that oak somewhat masks the fruit aromas and flavors, so this may be too extreme for purists.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While ripe bramble wood and herb tones are elegant, there's a slightly candied nature to the red cherry and berry flavors in this light-bodied Cabernet Franc. It's brisk, with a zesty, spry finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Freshness and a light herbaceous note carry this medium-bodied wine from the aroma through the flavors and to the finish. While it's is a touch sweet, bright citrus and lively green notes keep the wine balanced and appetizing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A full-bodied white, this is less fruity and more savory or mineral in character. Aromas are oily, a bit earthy and slightly mineral, while flavors show light pineapple and butter notes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The bright red fruit on the nose of this wine is joined with graphite minerality and sweetly toasted oak. The palate is quite fruity, boasting Bing cherry and strawberry reduction sauce, picking up complexity from cracked black pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this easygoing rosato doles out bright red cherry and pomegranate flavors alongside bright acidity. It's simple but well made.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deep in color, big in flavor and full bodied, this is a rustic, straightforward wine. It smells like very ripe blackberry and black cherry, tastes dense and feels full, tannic and firm-textured.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This conveys aromas of leafy underbrush, toasted oak and a weedy note. The lean palate offers dried red berry, green herb and astringent tannins but not much fruit richness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas recall coffee, toast and weedy underbrush. The lean palate offers licorice, espresso, black pepper and dried fruit flavors alongside clenched, aggressive tannins. While the tannins need to unwind, it lacks the fruit richness for lengthy aging. You'll also notice the heat of alcohol on the close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of oak, toast and coconut carry through to the palate along with spirit-soaked plum, fig and anisette. It doesn't have enough fruit richness to support the extremely astringent wood tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Berry, dried sage, licorice and menthol aromas lead the nose. The warm, one-dimensional palate offers toasted oak, coconut, spirit-soaked prune and vanilla alongside sharp, astringent tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine has great fruit with soft tannins and accessible soft black currant fruitiness. A slight earthiness at the end needs to become better integrated. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This direct and appealing wine offers notes of maple, sugared plum and woodspice. Flavors are light but plush in feel, straight down the fairway.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine offers notes of herbs, brown stems and blue fruit. It's medium bodied with tart acids and chalky, astringent tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Almond and a hint of raspberry register on an otherwise neutral nose. This feels round and citrusy, while flavors of orange, nectarine and pithy pink grapefruit end with a slight note of oxidation. Drink immediately.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Caressed in forested earthiness, this wine is both crisp in acidity and creamy in baked apple and crème brûlée, a layering of lemon meringue on top. It is integrated and balanced up until the finish, where a firm grip of oak takes hold.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "After a huge blast of mocha opens the show, there isn't a lot hiding behind the curtain. The palate is big, sticky and rubbery in feel, while flavors of baked berry, chocolate, oak and coffee finish chewy but also briny and herbal.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Despite some heat and burn to the nose, there's nothing not to like about aromas of pecan pie and toffee. This Moscatel sweetie is solid in feel, but mostly around the edges; the middle palate is a bit weak. Flavors of brown sugar and caramel are more sweet and simple than complex.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lighter in style, this offers notes of brambly blackberries, whole green pepper and dark coffee, with tart acids and dry, gritty tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of Syrah (59%) and Merlot, this wine is downright fruity with red currant, rose hips and fruit leather. It's pleasant and easy drinking, though the tannins seem a bit unresolved.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light wood aging sets the scene for this crisp and herbaceous wine. Citrus fruits give a juicy character and contrast with the mineral texture coming from the stony vineyard. It's a fresh wine to drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A dark, dry and firm wine, this is developing slowly. Its fruits show the influence of Cabernet in the blend with a strong tannic and black currant element. It will need several more years aging, so drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tough tannins are right up front with this wine. It has fruit and acidity, suppressed at the moment although enough to allow the wine to develop. The structure and smoky character are already promising an elegant, if always dry wine. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A fresh, blossomy perfume persists throughout many of Heron Hill's Rieslings, but this one is comparatively green and herbal in tone. Refreshing and dry, it's marked by lime and sage notes that inlay a zesty finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Calling a wine romantic is perhaps a new approach for Bordeaux. The wine itself is ripe and jammy, with wood tannins that will be softer in a year. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "As the name suggests, this fermentation brings in substantial flavors of herb and stem, cloaking its tight blueberry and black cherry fruit in that stiff, tannic robe. Let it breathe for some hours, or better yet decant it well in advance of drinking.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In this fresh and fruity wine, lively flavors of strawberry and watermelon are buoyed with adequate but not over-riding acidity. The finish is clean and lingering, inviting the next sip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Open and fruity, this delicious, already drinkable wine is a typical Portuguese blend that's dominated by Touriga Nacional. It has an attractive perfumed aroma along with toasty wood flavors and black currant freshness. The combination is full, forward and delicious now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spicy, gritty cherry aromas are dry and hard, but honest and fresh. This Cab Franc has a narrow, tannic, punchy mouthfeel and oak-rich flavors of red plum and currant along with vanilla. The finish is lively at first then fades away quietly.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Quite intense aromas of plum brandy and kirsch are boosted with scents of iron and black pepper on this bottling. The palate shows stewed cherries and strawberries, and there is both acidity and tannic grip, proving this to be a complete and solid wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A rich blend that includes the local Abouriou grape gives a structured, firm wine that has both tannins and juicy black fruits. The oak aging still shows in the spice and vanilla edge that underlies the fruitiness. It should be aged, so drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From vineyards at the top of slopes above the river Lot, this balanced wine moves easily between red cherry acidity and dark, young tannins. Still young, the tannic structure needs to mellow and will soften with time. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A really good wine for the price, this offers a dark color and varietal aromas of black cherry, black olive and faint dried herbs. Next it layers handsome oak on the rich and fruity flavors. The texture is quite dense without being heavy; while somewhat tannic the mouthfeel is not drying.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 40% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Syrah, this offers subtle aromas of mature black-skinned fruit and a whiff of white chocolate. The palate offers dried black cherry, espresso, cracked pepper and anise alongside packed tannins that leave an astringent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is very flavorful, fruity and full bodied. It maintains a sleek texture in spite of considerable tannins that keep it feeling dry. Aromas are like wild berries and cherry blossoms, the flavors are exotic and very ripe, and the finish keeps adding more fruit nuances.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of cedar, cinnamon and earth make a fascinating welcome, and the flavors are equally vivid, adding tart raspberry and pomegranate. This is medium bodied, lively with acidity and firm tannins, and nicely lean in profile.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Unusual notes of lemongrass and pine lend a curious twist to crisp apple, lime and honey tones in this deeply mineral auslese. Piercing acidity shocks the midpalate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This medium-bodied blend of Grenache, Syrah and Carignan delivers just what you'd expect from the appellation, it just does it better than most, at a modest price. Hints of bay leaf and wild thyme accent black cherry fruit and a touch of licorice, while the supple texture features a just slightly astringent finish. Drink now–2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dusty, briny citrus and apple aromas lead to a palate that's calm and only mildly bubbly and active. Lightly pickled lime and tangerine flavors finish dry, slightly bitter and briny, with a coarse but crisp feel of seltzer.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This light, airy varietal Pedro Xímenez offers leesy, melony aromas. The palate has a creamy feel bolstered by acidic zip. Leesy, waxy flavors of lime, melon and apple finish long, with tropical leanings. Drink this dry PX now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This winery produces luxuriously rich wines, and this blend of 47% Merlot, 30% Petit Verdot, 12% Malbec and 11% Cabernet Sauvignon fits right in. Aromas suggest vanilla-cherry cream, fresh cracked dark chocolate, mulberry extract and root beer. Cola, blackberries and woody herbs show once sipped.\n",

      "Melon, peach and honeysuckle swirl together on the very ripe nose, thanks to the blend of 42% Viognier, 24% Marsanne, 21% Grenache Blanc, 11% Roussanne and 2% Picpoul Blanc.

      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cranberries, raspberries and black cherries are in the fruit bowl here, with a hint of wet hay. Still sharp and spicy, it's astringent and offers a light hint of dried tobacco.

      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The winery's larger-scale Syrah (and that's still under 2,000 cases), this is a friendly, sophisticated Rhône-inspired wine grown on the cooler Sonoma Coast. Red and blue fruits are expertly ripe and high-toned, accented by layers of classic cool-climate spice.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Winemaker Anna Monticelli spent a harvest at Cheval Blanc in Bordeaux and worked under Philippe Melka at Seavey and Bryant Family.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Searingly crisp and yet generous and intense, this Chardonnay from one of grower Ulises Valdez's prime properties is muscular and expansive, rich in apple and honey and a seasoning of mouth-tingling spice.

      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Charbono is an old-fashioned variety that used to be planted in Napa Valley, before Cabernet Sauvignon took over. This bottling is bone dry and tannic, with lots of acidity. The wine is made in a style of 30 or 40 years ago, which is meant as a compliment. It's a complex, food-friendly wine of considerable interest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fennel, oak, apple and pear notes blend together in this full-bodied wine with robust structure and richness. Crème brûlée flavors join ginger and nutmeg elements, as the acidity refreshes and rewards.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Friendly, lemony freshness plays on the nose and palate, where it's joined by spicy grapefruit peel notes. That zestiness pervades the taut, straight-lined and utterly refreshing palate. This is concentrated, clean and full of citrusy verve.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This supple, seductive and sublime white is tart with acidity and bolstered by supportive oak. Pear, quince and an underlying hint of apple blossom combine in a lovely and focused expression on the palate that feels at once classic and balanced.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the producer's own Kivelstadt Vineyard, this compelling 100% varietal wine is sanguine and meaty. Black olive and black pepper flavors add to the larger savory landscape, bolstered by generous body, tannin and oak. It takes its time unraveling in the glass.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Another outstanding Renwood vineyard designate, this has great structure and abundant fruit flavors without overt oakiness. Full-bodied, smooth and seamless, exudes a wild berry and mineral character in the aroma and flavor, and keeps everything in balance due to moderate tannins and acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh-pressed strawberry, sugar beet, lavender and rose petal aromas show in this botting, which is a complex take on Tempranillo. Black plum and mulberry flavors are delicately presented, leading the intriguing and buoyant palate, which is light in body but full of elegant flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the property of a longtime vineyard manager for the winery, this bottling is deliciously unique. The nose abounds with earth, dried cherry, anise, roasted meat and herb aromas. The structure is solid and somewhat gripping, presenting deep red-fruit flavors with dried herb accents, driven by balanced acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Another of the producer's mountain reds, this features rough-hewn tannin that grips the palate with tenacity and power, yielding to show juicy acidity and fully realized cedar, dusty cranberry and cassis flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crisp green apple and Conference pear scents vie for attention in this wine. The slender palate adds a backdrop of yeasty savoriness yet remains sprightly and zippy. Riper fruit adds a more sonorous tone as it finishes, feeling full of citric verve and totally appetizing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "One of four monopole Central Coast bottlings from the Los Gatos winery, this bottling offers rich red cherry, vanilla, rose petal and watermelon scents on the nose. The palate is dry and structured, showing tart Montmorency cherry and hints of licorice and eucalyptus.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This cool site, set on sedimentary and volcanic soils, brings a blend of five clones into focus. Dark and juicy, muscular and complex, it weaves together plum and cherry fruit, a whiff of truffle, and finishes with a touch of coffee from the barrel aging.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With dusty gravel at its mineral core, this Cabernet Sauvignon layers rich red currant, cassis and clove flavors, suggesting French toast drizzled with compote. It has a juicy midpalate and a lingering finish that reverberates toasted, spicy oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Char and wood grain are prominent on a smoky nose with blackberry and black-currant aromas. Intense tannins and layered depth make for a full palate, while this tastes ripe and toasty, with blackberry and chocolate flavors. On the finish, mild herbal complexity mixed with latent oak are stirring. Drink through 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wood-aged rosé is complex and intense. The rich fruit is only one part of the structure of the wine which is perfumed, mineral and, for a rosé, dense. It is surely intended for food with its concentration and ripe aftertaste. The extra year of aging has made it ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this bears flavors of cherry, plum, grilled herb and pastry spice that are sustained by the chalky tannins and tender acids.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The name of the wine is, of course, a branding exercise in itself. Luckily, the wine inside the bottle is ripe and enjoyable. It's fruity, soft, gently tannic with juicy red fruits and black plums, all finished with fresh acidity. Drink now. Screwcap.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Enjoyable in a non-fruity style, this full-bodied wine has oaky, smoky, cigar-box aromas and flavors that hover over modest plum notes. A broad texture helps the flavors linger on the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An unusual medley of aromas include orange peel, dill, mint, thyme, espresso and oak. The palate offers coffee, toasted oak and sugary vanilla but it doesn't have much fruit richness. Astringent tannins give a short, bitter finish that dries out the mouth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an edgy wine with a mix of berry and cassis aromas along with harsh leather. It's mouthfilling and potent on the palate, where flavors of spiced berry and herbal-infused plum finish scratchy and with all the muscle one could ask for. Cariñena, Garnacha and Syrah is the blend.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Toasted pastry-crust and macadamia nut notes frame core aromas of white orchard fruits. The palate tastes concentrated and feels round, and snappy acids invigorate the finish.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoky and herbal upfront, this is a light-bodied wine with silky-soft tannins. The flavors are on the savory side, ranging from hickory smoke and hung game to dried mint and thyme. Worth trying with roasted or braised lamb.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plum and berry aromas are fresh, youthful and the slightest bit briny. In the mouth, this standard-fare Rioja is juicy and a bit rubbery in feel. Flavors of berry and plum match the nose, and the finish is fresh and grabby.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright, unadulterated plum and wild berry aromas set up a firm, grapy, powerful palate. With dark, almost syrupy flavors, this is a ripe Tempranillo that finishes with bounce and oomph.\n",

      "Savory aromas of hickory and slow-cooked meat are highly suggestive of southern barbecue. This feels blocky and tannic, with resiny notes to the palate. Clove, woodsmoke, BBQ sauce and other savory flavors are barrel driven, while the finish registers as dense, roasted and a bit hot.\n",

      "With a motto of “affordable luxury,” Layer Cake sources Chardonnay fruit from the fringes of pricey appellations. In this case it draws from Monterey County vineyards near the Santa Lucia Highlands and Santa Barbara County vineyard between the Santa Maria Valley and the Sta. Rita Hills. The results are solid for the price, with expressive aromas of honeydew and vanilla soda, and a palate of juicy melon and toasted oak. It is slightly boozy, so very much in the cocktail style, and is not for those afraid of oak.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rambunctious and brawny, it's burly in dark color and oaky black cherry and blackberry, with a pastoral earthiness. Higher in alcohol and tannin than many other Marimar wines, it's velvety on the palate, finishing with a meaty taste of game or bacon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a perfectly good rosé that's 90% Tempranillo and 10% Viura, hence the Clarete name. Fresh aromas of nectarine and citrus show a touch of yeasty vanilla, while the palate feels pure and zesty. Orange and pink grapefruit are the key flavors, and the finish is snappy.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is all juicy fruit, black cherries with just a modicum of tannin to hold it together. It's fresh, ripe and immediately attractive. Ready to drink now, but with those tannins it should also age 2016–2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is sweet, very rich and smooth. Firm tannins are cushioned by the ripe berry and red plum fruits to give a spicy wine with touches of wood, finishing with pepper from the alcohol. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With attractive peach and baked-apple flavors, this is immediately appealing. It balances acidity with a lightly off-dry style that's both fresh and ripe. It can be drunk now, but will be better in 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A note of cupcake batter hits the nose first, but it quickly integrates into the chief aromas of raspberries, ladyfingers and herbs. Powdery tannins provide some traction to the otherwise lithe palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine begins with aromas of oak, coffee bean and toast. The palate lacks fruit richness, offering instead dried tobacco leaf, oak extract, espresso, dried sage, vanilla and mocha alongside bitterly astringent tannins.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% varietal wine provides a perfect spot to explore this up-and-coming vineyard. Aromas of herbs and barrel spice are all high toned, with the fruit still seeming locked up.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With significant amounts of Mourvèdre (15%) and Grenache (8%) blended in, this drinks more like a GSM than a Syrah. Cranberry, herb and woodspice aromas are followed by tart, sleek fruit and smoke flavors that linger.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark red-violet in the glass, this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Grenache has a nose of black cherry, green pepper and cocoa. It may be a little too cool for some tastes, but bright fruit and slightly luxurious tannins make up for the fennel and eucalyptus flavors that are joined on the palate by cherry, pomegranate and orange zest. The smooth finish goes completely cool for a second but winds up in a burst of bright fruit.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "The melon, pear, tropical fruit and almond butter aromas are bright and effusive, while the flavors are considerably more delicate and subdued, showing a lovely sense of nuance and tension. It doesn't quite all come together but provides plenty of intrigue.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dusty, melony aromas hint at the tropical end of the aromatic spectrum. This is predominantly austere in feel, with a touch of leesy weight. Lemon, pineapple and mango flavors end with general softness propped up acidic cut. Drink immediately.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This garnet-colored Ruen smells like fresh cherry juice, pomegranate, and pencil lead, not to mention a pleasant whiff of petrol. It is soft on entry, tasting of black cherry and pomegranate with chewy tannins.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Heady potpourri notes of rose petal and spice, lychee and melon abound on this high-impact but refined Gewürztraminer. Off dry and delicately framed, it's a refreshing sip marked by sunny squirts of tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2017.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A 100% Roussanne wine is rare in its normal origin, the Rhône Valley. Here, in the mountains, it has produced this intensely perfumed, tightly textured wine that is both unusual and delicious. Crisply textured and with spice and a dry edge, the wine could be aged for a few months. Drink from the end of 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Forward berry aromas are more clean and fresh than complex. On the palate, this is similar, with bold, freshening acidity. Flavorwise, this leans into the black-fruit spectrum, while mint, spice and peppery flavors grace the finish.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of high-toned cocoa, vanilla, coconut, pencil lead and baking spices lead to plentiful black fruit flavors, with a lick of grainy tannins backing them up. The barrel notes get out front at times but it still provides a lot of quality and value.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big and chewy, this starts with aromas of grilled porcini, underbrush, ripe dark fruit, dried herb and clove. Tightly packed tannins frame dried black cherry, prune steeped in spirits, ground pepper and licorice. You'll also feel the heat of evident alcohol on the midpalate that throws it somewhat off-balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plum, vanilla, sunbaked earth and espresso aromas take shape in the glass. The structured palate offers dried red cherry, roasted coffee bean and vanilla alongside fine-grained tannins that clutch the finish.\n",

      "Aromas of mature berry, espresso, exotic spice and a whiff of menthol emerge on this full-bodied red.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of black currant, orange zest and lemon thyme set the scene for a three-way balancing act of fruit, savory and cool flavors. On the palate, notes of black cherry, lingonberry, eucalyptus, mint and thyme stand out, and gentle tannins ride on through a cherry and mint finish.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a finely integrated, rich wine that shows impeccable balance between dusty tannins and juicy dark berry tones.

Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is dense, ripe and full of rich apricot and peach flavors, with a line of crisp lemon and a background of toast. Full in the mouth, this generous wine will be ready to drink from 2017. It comes Louis Max domaine vineyards in and around Mercurey.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a rich wine with smooth tannins that are integrated into the ripe black fruits. It's packed with juicy fruitiness. It also has a dry core and acidity, both of which will allow the wine to age. Concentrated, it is ready to drink now, although it will be better from 2017.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fermented with roughly one-third whole clusters, this wine brings a juicy mix of blackberry and black-cherry fruit front and center, with the AVA's wet-stone minerality underneath.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "While 2013 was not a great Port year, it produced some attractive Vintage wines such as this one. It is likely to develop quickly, already showing ripe fruit and generous dried prune flavors along with the firmer tannins. Drink this from 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a smooth and fruity wine that is named after the matriarch of the family. It has some structure and a dry core, although it is the rich red and black fruits that create its main character. It is developing well, with a fine juicy streak. Drink from 2017.\n",

      "A solid blend of aromatic floral notes and spicy fruit, this opens with scents of rose petals and moves into a midpalate featuring red plum. There are hints of dried pine needles and overall a palate-pleasing texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plump blueberries, slate, gravel, turned earth and a light fennel character show on this wine, which comes in a custom bottle exclusive to the appellation's estate-grown Syrahs. The palate shows a lively acidity that briskly expresses the black pepper, black currant and espresso flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mouthcoating, this is a full-bodied wine with small amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Tar, leather, cedar and black cherry stand out as characteristics, with added weight from the heavier, darker elements of chocolate and oak. Drink now through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "One of three new wines for the producer in this vintage, this one is a blend from the Russian River Valley and Carneros estate ranches, Winside and Lawler. Pleasurable from start to finish, it's rich and brooding in black fruit and a touch of graphite, with a balance of lush earthiness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot, this wine offers a bouquet that is equal parts black plum and green pepper. Fruit holds sway over chalky tannins, with flavors of black cherry and raspberry that are joined by chocolate covered espresso bean and green pepper notes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "More mineral, perhaps even crystalline, in style compared to Thörle's Saulheimer Probstey Silvaner, this elegant bottling showcases pristine grapefruit and tangerine flavors. It's full bodied yet silky, uplifted by a swathe of freshly cut grass and mint that lingers long on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This extroverted and very yummy wine is dark and deep in color. It smells like it's drenched in blackberry jam and tastes almost as thick. Gobs of boysenberry and blackberry flavors carry hints of chocolate and cherry. It's not too full bodied, just full flavored.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Forest floor and fresh-dug earth form a core around this wine's crisp, clear hit of red cherry. Buoyant acidity keeps it light and bright, with unfettered oak and tannin.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Delicately perfumed with red berry, violet and a whisper of chopped mint, this is a young, elegant expression of Nebbiolo. The bright, linear palate doles out crushed cherry, juicy strawberry, white pepper and cinnamon framed in lively acidity and polished tannins. Enjoy through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rose, strawberry and forest floor aromas meld in the glass on this charming expression of Nebbiolo. The bright, savory palate doles out crushed strawberry, black raspberry, clove and star anise alongside silky tannins. Like a little black dress, this would be perfect for any occasion.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Targeted aromas of citrus, apple, grass and minerals precede a lemony laser-sharp palate that sweats the insides of one's cheeks with battery level acidity. Chiseled flavors of lemon and green apple finish long, pure and persistent.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Red fruit aromas are a bit rough and scalped in front of a chunky palate. Charred, burnt, oaky flavors of raspberry and cassis stress ripeness and weight before finishing with buttery oak, a slightly greasy feel and roasted berry flavors. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bold wine has a very dark color and fresh, concentrated blackberry aromas. Generous berry and black pepper flavors seem to saturate the taste buds, leading to a lingering fruit and spice finish. The texture is almost viscous, as lots of fine tannins add grip. It's the rare wine with no added sulfites.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This ripe Malbec offers jammy blueberry aromas that hint at raisin but pull back in the nick of time. A round pulpy palate is home to black cherry, berry and plum flavors supported by loamy earthy notes. A fleshy finish isn't exact but it's friendly. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy notes of porcini mushroom and black olive blend with balsamic plum and cherry aromas. This is a touch heavy and syrupy in feel, and thus creamy flavors of chocolate, plum and berry are not surprising. On the finish, this remains creamy and ripe.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Juicy bursts of ripe blackberry and blueberry are reined in by a firm backbone of acidity and cool herbal swathes in this full-bodied Lemberger. Just softly fringed by tannins, it's an approachable but sophisticated wine to enjoy now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bracing and tangy, this light-bodied wine has distinct melon aromas, similar flavors and tasty accents of white pepper and fresh fennel. While nicely reserved it also has complexity and great balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy plum and raspberry aromas are subtle. This is tight on the palate, with firm tannins and slightly elevated acidity. Earthy, lightly toasted raspberry and plum flavors finish dry. As a whole, this is well made and exceeds expectations.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is deliberately picked early to preserve acidity and aging potential. At nine years of age, the result is a wine that's just beginning to mature yet remains youthful, with bright lemon notes and a long, dry finish. If you prefer additional richness, hold until at least 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Chardonnay brings scents of pear juice, apple and a light whiff of mint. It is smooth on entry with flavors of caramelized pineapple and golden apple. It has good balance and a clean finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Subdued aromas of spring wild flower, hay and orchard fruit float from the glass. The vibrant palate offers lemon zest, sage, dried herb and a hint of saline framed in lively acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Subtle and elegant, this opens with a smoky aroma that underscores delicate scents of orchard fruit, citrus and botanical herb. The aromas follow through to the linear palate along with a racy mineral vein. A note of cured meat closes the racy finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh and crisply fruity, this is a balanced, lively wine. A touch of caramel adds to the tannic edge, giving the wine a good structure along with ripe strawberry fruits. The wine is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a fresh but also full and rich wine with ripe pear and raspberry fruits. The wine is balanced and ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 40% Ribolla Gialla, 30% Chardonnay and 30% Sauvignonasse has aromas of freshly cut grass, lemon grass and white peach. It is clean and bright in the mouth with flavors of peach, apple, pear and apricot.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Apple blossom, lemon butter and white peach aromas show on the nose of this very clean and crisp bottling. There is solid acidity and grippy texture to the palate, where sea salt, caramel apple and more white peach flavors arise. Great sizzle on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Relatively light in the glass, this blend of nine vineyards from up and down the coast shows savory baked plum, cardamom dust, earthy cranberry, bay leaf and smoked meat on the nose. It's medium bodied on the palate and very down-the-middle flavor-wise, with cranberry, oregano and thyme elements.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Just four barrels were produced of this reserve, which sports a distinctive black label. The fruit is chunky and scented strongly with cinnamon. Even with extended airing, the wine feels diffuse, and the flavors thin out rather quickly. A bit disappointing given the vintage.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bracingly effervescent bubbles offer aromas of baking soda, chalk and blood orange on this South Coast sparkler made from 82% Chardonnay and 18% Pinot Noir. The foamy palate offers inviting bubblegum and light cotton candy flavors, never sweet but very rounded and approachable in a crowd-pleasing way.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Strong veins of licorice, vanilla and tobacco run through this wine. Light plummy fruit, supporting acids and smooth tannins roll into a finish with more heat than the listed alcohol suggests.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a clean and vibrant rosé, with upfront notes of lavender, menthol and bay that frame red cherry and berry tones. The palate is fleshy and fruit-forward, with bold flavors of peach and strawberry that transition seamlessly into the citrus-zest finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Zippy lemon and grapefruit flavors are limned with honey and lanolin in this delicately off-dry Riesling. Vivacious and light-footed, it's a uniquely nuanced wine with a lingering slate-edged finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine initially presents itself as lighter in body than it actually is, a tease from the cool-climate aromas of cucumber, dill and cranberry tea. The oak is toasty with a whiff of smoke, the acidity somewhat subdued. An appealing funk of earth gives it varietal distinction.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raisin, pastry and plum aromas are smooth and generous given how cool 2013 was in Rioja. There's good acidity and body to go with flavors of plum, blackberry and toasty oak. Finishing notes of coffee, toast and chocolate are fully oaked, which lends a sense of sweetness to this Crianza.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe red apple and peach notes perfume this zippy off-dry Riesling. Light bodied and lemony fresh, it's invigorating on the palate. Finishes moderately long, accented by whispers of saffron and spice. Drink now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offers aromas of yellow stone fruit, chopped herb and a whiff of white almond. The round, juicy palate shows apricot, white peach, candied orange zest and a mineral note. Fresh acidity brightens the ripe flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is just over half Cabernet Sauvignon (55%), with the rest Merlot (20%), Malbec (15%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of dark cherry meats, plum, herb and spice are followed by elegant fruit flavors backed by a firm grip of lightly dry tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pear and nectarine flesh are cut by a quince, Gala apple and slightest touches of guava and mango on the chalky nose of this wine. It's refreshingly light on the palate, with sliced pear and squeezed lime notes, bound by a very grippy texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose is very quiet but the body emanates a generosity despite its lightness. There is red-cherry fruit and a certain ampleness on a slender, fresh body. Tannins are like barely-there linens. The finish is wonderfully clean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Scents of Spanish broom, chamomile, aromatic herb and white stone fruit combine along with a whiff of hay. The zesty, linear palate offers juicy nectarine, candied lemon drop and a mineral note alongside bright acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Friendly, sunny and fresh fruit notes of yellow pear, Mirabelle plum and red apple shine on nose and palate. This is easy but chock-full of fruit. There is something intangibly smiley about this wine, which has something of spring sunshine and happiness on its slender, fresh body.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The merest hint of oak spice wafts from the nose. The palate has that softly oaked, spiced roundedness that adds cinnamon and a touch of vanilla to gentle but not overtly expressed berry notes. There is some tannic grip, too.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Yellow rose petals and yellow plums unite on the nose. The palate broadens out into generous earthiness that is textured and broad but kept in beautiful focus by utter freshness. The finish lingers.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A touch of earth is bound up with the ripe, juicy and tart pear flavors. This wine is slender and clean with lemon freshness. The concentrated palate focuses on that crisp, ripe lemon note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose hints at the soft, crips yellow pear fruit that abounds on the palate, countered by brisk, clean freshness. This wine has an enlivening palate with a juicy, lip-smacking finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is a velvet glove in an iron fist. The smooth surface of ripe fruits and rich blackberry flavors, masks the dense tannins that will allow this very great wine to age for many, many years. The acidity and the rich fruit combine with the fine dusty tannins. The wine will surely not be ready to drink before 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This rich, hearty and ultimately lovely blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc and 8% Petit Verdot still needs time to open up. When it does, expect dense and pure aromas of blueberry, black currant, graphite and nose-tickling spice. The palate's intense structure, though shy for now, reveals charred beef, coffee, caramel, black cherry and dried rose flavors. Drink 2019–2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark-skinned berry, forest floor, pipe tobacco, new leather and balsamic notes float out of the glass. On the elegantly structured palate, taut, polished tannins and vibrant acidity frame ripe red cherry, exotic spice and aromatic herb flavors. A lingering star anise note announces the close. Impeccably balanced and loaded with class, it's still young and needs time to fully develop. Drink 2022–2037.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Richly endowed, the wine is beautifully concentrated. Still young it has considerable potential with its rich fruits and firm tannins. There is a strongly juicy aftertaste that brings in the freshness of the year. The wine will age well, and should not be drunk before 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lifted notes of dried pear, dried chamomile flowers and dried lemon peel have a strong impact. The palate comes in with lovely generous sweetness that amplifies that chamomile-tisane notion and boosts the dried-fruit notes. Against the distinctly medium-sweet fruitiness stands a clarion line of acidity. The evolution of fruit flavors weaves a colorful tapestry of aromas. This is carefully balanced and quietly intense. It holds immense strength at its core that radiates flavor and fruit. Made from a field blend of Alsace varieties, each adds something: aroma, texture, freshness and body. The finish is endless and very fruity. Have this with cheese or a subtle dessert. Drink now through 2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A hint of caramelized apple clings to the nose, as well as a certain creaminess. The palate reveals a core of stone, chalk and lanolin, all framed with the purest notion of lemon zest. This shows lovely flavors of maturity but has only just got going. The freshness is incisive, the complexity and length immense. This is simply beautiful and leaves you totally refreshed. Savor this slowly. Drink now through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An incredibly pure and piercing note of lemon oil hits the nose. The medium-sweet palate impresses with both fresh and dried notes of fruit: plum, white sultana, white currant and the ripest pear and apple you can imagine. This is full-on and big but balanced by tingling, fresh and precise acidity. A field blend of polar opposites, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, this unites their virtues of aromatic textured richness and poised finesse. Again, this is not a wine that is easily categorized with its medium-sweet, soil- and fruit-driven profile, but it is a joy to experience and savor. The finish lasts and lasts. Drink 2017–2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This splendid, resonant, beautifully detailed wine captures everything that is most desirable in the 2014 vintage. Blackberry and black cherry fruit, adorned with a sprinkling of Sumatra coffee beans, rocks on with polished tannins. The pleasing roasted character is just right to power it through a clean, sexy finish. Drink now and on through 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It's a shame more producers don't hold their Pinot Noirs back longer, for this bottling from Joe Davis reveals so much depth compared to current releases. Raspberry, rose petal, cola and cinnamon stick show on the nose, while the palate offers rounded flavors of dried strawberry, thyme and game. It's all intricately woven by time into something wonderful.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tight tannins mask the ripe fruit in a wine that is set for long-term aging, so there is a dry core that dominates at the moment. But not for long: the bold black fruits are insistent and are going to be delicious. This is a structured wine that will be ready in 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A lovely touch of flint and smoke carry a touch of residual reduction. Underneath that is lemony purity. The palate adds a touch of stone fruit, a touch of ripe mirabelle plum—its generosity only underlined by the taut lemon freshness that pervades the wine. There is something stern and stony at the core, something fundamental and profound. The body is precise, dry and powerful and incredibly moreish. This is lip smacking but has not even started to show itself properly. The finish is clean, stony and lasting. This is one to keep. Drink 2020–2040.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here's a delicious red that opens with appealing ripe plum, blue flower, tobacco and baking spice aromas. Velvety tannins and fresh acidity provide structure and balance, while while juicy black cherry, raspberry compote and licorice flavors envelope the palate. Drink 2019–2032.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a powerfully structured wine from a 18-acre property on the plateau of Pomerol. Rich Merlot dominates and gives the wine both its alcohol and its intense tannins and juicy red fruits. The wine is dense with the potential for aging over a considerable time. Drink from 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is something heady about this: a hint of chamomile tincture and pure lemon zest. The palate cuts in with uncompromising purity and zestiness—this really wants to showcase pure stone and tart citrus. There are glimpses, however, of plump ripe mirabelle plums and a touch of dried pear and quince. Nonetheless, this is governed by stern tanginess and thus is for real adults only. This is dry, slender and shows absolute focus. A celebration of stone and Riesling. Don't drink this now but wait: Drink 2020–2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Seductive and velvety, this concentrated Pinot Noir is richly layered in raspberry cherry cordial, cardamom and cola flavors. Pine and allspice notes contribute a homey spiciness as as the fullness of the wine lingers into a long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The heady scent of Damask rose hints unmistakably to Gewürztraminer. The palate follows lusciously, generously and luxuriantly: wonderfully sweet notions of peach, ripe apricot and yellow mirabelle plum are perfumed with a rose petal scent but are also pervaded by a gentle citrus freshness that lifts everything. The length is astonishing and dreamy. This is dangerously delicious.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "After a touch of funky reduction, beautiful hints of herbs appear: yarrow and lemon balm play alongside lemon and crisp green-apple aromas. On the palate, these notions all remain taut along a very linear, slender but concentrated body that owes more to citrus than to apples. There is a powerful enduring core of fruit and stone that will make this last. The flavors echo long and leave the mouth totally clean. Drink now through 2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Forest floor, aromatic herb, dark spice and eucalyptus aromas come together with a floral twist. Bright and elegant, the palate shows succulent wild cherry, white pepper, star anise and chopped mint flavors. With its taut, fine-grained tannins and firm acidity, it needs time to unwind and fully develop. Drink 2022–2032.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Forest floor, wild berry, new leather and balsam are some of the aromas you'll find in this bright, linear red. On the palate, firm, polished tannins support ripe red cherry, white pepper, andcrushed mint notes with a hint of black tea. It's still young and tightly wound but already boasts stunning elegance. Drink 2020–2032.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Truffle, leather, forest floor, pipe tobacco and purple flower aromas all come together in this young, balanced Brunello. The palate is taut and chewy, with a nervous tension that offsets its juicy Marasca cherry, raspberry, licorice and clove flavors. Its fresh acidity and polished tannins promise good aging potential. Drink 2020–2032.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Another longtime standout for Williams Selyem, Allen Vineyard fruit imparts textural subtleties and a wealth of minerality and freshness. Citrus-driven in its cranberry and orange flavors, it shows depth and complexity, accented by lively thyme and clove notes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoky clove and rose petal aromas underlie a delicately complex fruitiness in this wine, its cranberry and pomegranate flavors complemented by cardamon, dried herb and savory black tea. Light-bodied and fresh, it offers an indelible silkiness on the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Captivating wild berry, rose, chopped herb and baking spice aromas take center stage in this earthy, stunning wine. The palate mirrors the nose in vibrancy, delivering tight layers of wild cherry, star anise and white pepper notes. Fresh acidity and firm, refined tannins provide a polished framework. It's loaded with finesse and already delicious, but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2020–2032.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spice from wood aging gives this rich wine its great character. It is supported by the tropical and white fruits. It is developing into a ripe full wine, delicious with its acidity and with its tangy aftertaste. Drink from 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a wine with great balance and elegance as well as richness. With layers of fine dusty tannins it has a warm character that is repeated in the perfumed fruit and juicy acidity. The wine is impressive, likely to age well. Drink from 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is rich with layers of wood aging and ripe tropical fruits. Pineapple and peach dominate, cut with some attractive lime acidity. Full of the fruit of the vintage with a texture of serious intent, the wine is tight, tangy and likely to age well. Drink from 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark spice, ripe berry, forest floor, Mediterranean brush and new leather aromas lead the nose on this powerfully structured wine. On the full-bodied palate, baking spice, licorice and pipe tobacco notes accent a juicy black cherry core while firm, velvety tannins provide the framework. Drink 2020–2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe black-skinned fruit, underbrush, truffle and dark spice aromas come together in this full-bodied red. The palate is firm and seamless, delivering mature black cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and pipe tobacco flavors with both power and finesse. Tightly knit, polished tannins provide structure. Drink 2022–2032.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Utter generosity of both ripe and dried pear is immediately evident on the nose. Notions of sandalwood hover. The dry palate carries that same, generous fluidity at its deep core. There is immense concentration, shimmering with dried, fresh and cooked pear. But there also is a sense of earth, stone and fresh orange peel. The wine seems like a message from another world, , leading you beyond the physical, into a wold of contemplation. The finish lasts and lasts.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose is still shy but already tells of tender sweetness. The palate has a rounded earthy smoky element that grounds the luscious generous fruit of dried pear and supersweet Reine Claude and mirabelle plums. The sweetness of this SGN is balanced and almost fresh, but the intriguing thing is a kind of smoky, dark and mysterious core of stone.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A fresh, blossomy perfume persists throughout many of Heron Hill's Rieslings, but this one is comparatively green and herbal in tone. Refreshing and dry, it's marked by lime and sage notes that inlay a zesty finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While this wine has plenty of ripe fruit, it also has a smoky character from the wood aging. Red berry fruits give a fresh feel, balanced already with the soft tannins. It's going to develop quickly, so drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose on this well-priced wine of mostly Paso Robles fruit is initially hidden, but patience reveals mossy forest-floor notes alongside charred, crushed herbs. The palate also leans more toward savory than ripe fruit, with oregano and thyme most prevalent, although quite restrained altogether.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromatically restrained, this dry, refreshing wine highlights minerality over fruit. Fresh lime and lemon flavors brighten the palate, but fade quickly on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pressed apple and pear notes are brightened by a kiss of yellow cherries and lemon in this delicate wine. The palate has a pleasant roundness despite its light-bodied frame. The finish is brisk.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of sour red cherry, white pepper and citrus lead the nose on this blend of 90% Syrah and 10% Merlot. The simple palate offers pink grapefruit and juicy apple alongside bright acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Layers of vanilla, spice and toast persist throughout this richly textured wine. Sunny raspberry and cherry flavors are pleasant, but peek through a bit shyly on the palate. It's an oaky wine, but supple and seductive with a fringe of finely grained, persistent tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cos d'Estournel's Médoc venture is still not quite in its place. This wine has ripe blackberry fruits, but an earthy character gives it a rough edge. Drink from 2017.\n",

      "Calling a wine romantic is perhaps a new approach for Bordeaux. The wine itself is ripe and jammy, with wood tannins that will be softer in a year. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Chunky, oxidized aromas of melon and white stone fruits settle on heavy and bland. There's acidic snap to this Verdejo but also a rubbery feel to the palate. Yeasty flavors of baked apple and peach finish lightly oxidized and almondy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine from Klipsun and Alder Ridge vineyards—aged in 100% new French oak—offers notes of coffee, herbs, jammy fruit and green wood. Flavors are full, plummy and sugary-sweet backed by firm tannins and sharp-edged acids.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The very lively nose blends milky marzipan, ruby-red grapefruit juice, ripe nectarine and rain on concrete. Given those dynamics, the palate isn't as compelling, presenting apple, pear, orange peel, lemon juice and a vanilla-custard finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aged in a mixture of new French (80%) and American oak, this leads with barrel notes of woodspice followed by herbs, brown stems, blue fruit and cinnamon. It shows good concentration with quite tart acids and dry, chalky tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine offers notes of smoke, tire rubber and red currant that show a hint of confection. Flavors are sweet and elegant, with a dry squeeze of tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh and fruity, this has light tannins and a stalky black currant character that will produce a smooth and juicy wine as it ages. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light ruby in color, this offers fresh raspberry and red cherry aromas, slightly softer flavors of ripe plum and a smooth texture. It is medium bodied and easy to enjoy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The color is deeper and darker than average. Aromas are like superripe plums, while flavors resemble sweet plums and blackberries. It's a generous and smooth wine that's not deep in flavor, but pleasant and easy to enjoy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This light-bodied blend of 70% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot offers flavors of sour cherry and red currant. It's easy drinking but rather lean, with fleeting tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Violet florals and ripe blackberry perfume are alluring on this Merlot-Cabernet blend. The palate is particularly plump with luscious, slightly confected, black-cherry preserve flavor, but tightened on the finish by a ruffle of grippy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fruity and herbal in flavor and generous in texture, this is medium to full bodied and quite smooth in mouth feel. It smells like currants, black olives and dried herbs, and tastes a bit savory and complex along with the plummy fruit flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The 15th-century tower of the governor of Monségur gives its name to this wine from the local cooperative. It's a solid wine that has firm tannins along with jammy plum fruits and a ripe character. Blackberries dominate allowing some room, maybe not enough, for the acidity at the end. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big and brawny, this has bold, ripe fruit aromas and flavors that are shaded by thyme and dill, and backed by very firm tannins and good acidity. The mouthfeel is full and astringent, and the mouth-puckering tannins last on the finish. Enjoy it now with pork ribs or flank steak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pure Sauvignon Blanc, this is fresh and herbaceous while also having some ripe red apple and quince flavors. The wine is crisp, packed with acidity and delivers a lively, bright aftertaste. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe blackberry meets with rustic leather and a bit of rubbery funk on this nose of this wine made by the Riboli family of Los Angeles' San Antonio Winery. It's rich and jammy with tannins adding balance, but not much acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Stalky, grassy, baked-berry aromas are earthy and challenging. This features a classic aged-Rioja palate of raw acidity and raisiny weight, with dried fruit and baked berry flavors backing that up. A baked quality drives the finish as well.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The bright yellow gold color, familiar aromas of buttered toast, and ripe apple and pear flavors add up to a well-made and well-rounded wine. It's a lighter version of a classic, being medium-bodied and soft on the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Layers of smoke, dark toast and nuts lend a distinctly savory feel. This wine is refreshingly brisk on the palate, marked by delicate touches of pressed apple and pear that linger through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A strong, toasted, smoky aroma and charred oak flavors define this medium-bodied, rich-textured wine. Not exactly light on its feet, but fans of oak will appreciate the bold, toasty, buttery character.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A fairly substantial white wine, it is medium to full in body, with fresh melon aromas and vivid melon and crisp apple flavors. A plush texture gives it some breadth and length on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wood takes center stage on this wine. Char, dark roasted coffee, chocolate and vanilla are followed by sweet fruit and oak flavors backed by firm, dry tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This cool site, set on sedimentary and volcanic soils, brings a blend of five clones into focus. Dark and juicy, muscular and complex, it weaves together plum and cherry fruit, a whiff of truffle, and finishes with a touch of coffee from the barrel aging.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With dusty gravel at its mineral core, this Cabernet Sauvignon layers rich red currant, cassis and clove flavors, suggesting French toast drizzled with compote. It has a juicy midpalate and a lingering finish that reverberates toasted, spicy oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Char and wood grain are prominent on a smoky nose with blackberry and black-currant aromas. Intense tannins and layered depth make for a full palate, while this tastes ripe and toasty, with blackberry and chocolate flavors. On the finish, mild herbal complexity mixed with latent oak are stirring. Drink through 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wood-aged rosé is complex and intense. The rich fruit is only one part of the structure of the wine which is perfumed, mineral and, for a rosé, dense. It is surely intended for food with its concentration and ripe aftertaste. The extra year of aging has made it ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a serious rosé. It has plenty of fruitiness of course, but it also has texture and the potential to age a few months. The wine is rich, full of red-berry fruits and with a touch of minerality. It is fruity now, but will be best from early 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe stone fruit notes, especially aromatic Mirabelle plum, rise from the glass, alongside more evolved chamomile tisane scents. With its slight bottle age, this shows where evolution can lead Grüner Veltliner. The palate retains its zesty, salty savoriness yet is wonderfully concentrated. Juicy Mirabelle reappears on the long, savory finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In its singular oval bottle, this is the top cuvée of this prestigious estate close to Saint-Tropez. It is a lively and fruity wine with great acidity and richness. It has spice as well as red-currant and raspberry fruitiness. This is definitely a wine for food, with its edge of structured acidity and bone dry aftertaste. Drink from late 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Toasty, oaky aromas of graphite, pepper, barrel char and black fruits properly announce a palate of chewy tannins and several layers of blackberry, cassis, barrel-spice, toast and chocolate flavors. Chocolaty depth on the finish only adds to the package. Drink through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "York Mountain actually predates Paso Robles as an appellation, so it's great to see Neil Collins making such excellent wine from its nearly forgotten western slopes. This bottling shows stewed blackberry, balsamic fig, licorice spice and purple flower touches on the nose. The well-integrated palate uses sprightly acidity to deliver blackberry and blueberry flavors, with thyme, nettle, dill and graphite accents.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lovely cinnamon-tinged blueberry and plum notes rise enticingly from the glass. The palate is firm and fresh, cracking with taut, ripe plum and cherry fruit. This is fresh-faced and honest red with just the right amount of grip and structure. The finish is beautifully clean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Winemaker Nick Elliott taps into the biodynamic vineyard planted by Syrah legend Bob Lindquist to deliver this rich bottling. It's full of roasted black fruit aromasl, with nori, soy and even organ meat touches on the nose. Peppery spice and charred beef flavors accent the lavish palate, while thick tannins frame ripe black-currant flavors on a bed of unwavering acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a dense bottling of the Italian grape, with salt-and-pepper touches spicing up the baked raspberry, cranberry and ginger cake aromas on the nose. The palate shows deep flavors reminiscent of dried strawberry, rust, leather and shaved chocolate. Firm tannins provide structure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's an exotic edge to the nose of this wine, suggesting juicy, ripe mango and passion fruit. The palate is zesty and fresh and still rings with yeasty savor. It's slender yet concentrated and has a lasting flavor that encompasses yeasty richness and citrus tones. Lip-smackingly refreshing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spicy acidity and a refreshing lift of lemon verbena highlight this unoaked wine, framing its medium body and lemon verbena, mandarin orange and grapefruit peel flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is not your parents' crisp and lean Barbera. Ripe, juicy and concentrated, it's so rich and opulent that it seems sweet. From the aromas through the lingeirng finish, it generously doles out raspberry syrup and blackberry jam notes, as well as a chocolaty accent from oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon is succulently smooth yet big boned and slightly smoky. Red cherry and berry fruit provides plushness on the palate, upheld by tight, firm tannins and supportive oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This dense, richly thick wine is full of black pepper and leather flavors that complement its bright layers of black currant, plum and dark cherry fruit. Full bodied and balanced, it offers further complexity as it unwinds in the glass.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Finally, this wine has been brought to the U.S. There were only 40 cases imported, so it may be difficult to track down, but it's worth a search. It's light to medium in body, but with an expansive nose of toasted brioche. That note combines with hints of mixed citrus and tart berries on the palate, then comes to a clean, refreshing close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from 80% Syrah, 15% Grenache and 5% Riesling, this magenta-hued wine shows exuberant orange blossom and cherry flavors buoyed by moderate acidity and seaspray-like freshness. It finishes rich and fruity, bringing a creamsicle in summer to mind.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe orchard fruit, pressed Spanish broom, crushed herb and citrus aromas take shape in the glass. On the palate, candied lemon underscores ripe yellow apple and pear flavors, alongside tangy acidity. A savory mineral note graces the finish. Fantastic wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe plum, cranberry, pressed violet, tobacco and damp soil aromas lead the nose, along with a whiff of clove. The round, polished palate offers dried black cherry, prune, raspberry jam and licorice notes, alongside smooth tannins. It's already extremely approachable, so drink soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This massive heavily oaked blend of 94% Tinta de Toro and 6% Garnacha smells like a cross between café mocha and a sawmill, with baking spices thrown in for good measure. The palate is rough and tannic, while oaky flavors of clove dominate blackberry fruit. On the finish, more clove is apparent, while the tannic clamp is severe. Drink through 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A dried herb kick is the hallmark of wines made by this producer, and this bottling may wear that note best, its fresh-pressed blackberry aromas accented with thyme and oregano. The palate blends those savory tones with light purple fruit and caramel and coffee touches, finishing on peppery spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a smoky oak tinge to this bottling from actress Challen Cates and winemaker Kevin Law, with black raspberry and sandalwood notes as well. The palate intrigues with salty dark cranberry and penetrating Mediterranean herb flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Consistent with past releases, this estate-grown effort includes Dijon 76 and 95 clonal material, planted in 1995. It's toasty in both nose and taste, with a tight core of green-berry, apple and banana fruit. As it breathes open there's a dollop of cream, just enough to smooth out the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blackberry and pressed violet aromas lead the nose of this bottling, while charred beef, lava rock and black soil scents provide depth. A roasted game flavor dominates the palate, spiced with black pepper and soy sauce and bolstered by a concentrated base of black fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This remarkably bone-dry wine from a cool-climate vineyard shows black plum, smoked beef, cracked peppercorn and slate scents on the nose. The palate recalls cedar and sandalwood, along with charcoal, pepper and soy-like flavors, framed by chalky and firm tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This fragrant blend of Nero d'Avola and Frappato boasts alluring blue flower, black-skinned berry and leather aromas. The balanced, savory palate doles out ripe black cherry, clove and licorice flavors, with round, polished tannins that give it a smooth texture. Enjoy through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is half Merlot, with the rest equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Brooding aromas of black licorice, barrel spice and dark fruit lead to plentiful fruit and barrel flavors that show a lovely sense of balance. The tannins bring some grip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Close to half Viognier, this is cofermented with Roussanne and Marsanne, then blended with 7% Grenache Blanc. A small portion of the Viognier was fermented in Acacia oak. Deep and rich flavors are packed with sliced pear, then range on through oranges and mixed citrus, adding a touch of vanilla in a fresh tangy lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Strong white flower aromas, from honeysuckle to jasmine to tuberose, meet with fresh apple blossoms and tropical elements of banana and coconut on the nose of the bottling, a blend of 60% Marsanne, 38% Roussanne and 2% Grenache Blanc. There's a sharp and sizzling acidity on the palate, where apple flesh and red pear flavors dance across the tongue with gusto.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Toast, oak, coffee, underbrush and baked plum aromas unfold on this extremely ripe, full-bodied wine. The densely concentrated palate delivers blackberry jam, licorice, oak roasted coffee bean, coconut and a vanilla note alongside astringent tannins. Give the tannins another few years to soften then drink sooner rather than later.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Richly layered, the nose offers pan-fried apples, butter, vanilla, cinnamon brioche, fleshy peach and roasted nuts. The palate is action-packed with brown spice, juicy lemons and ripe cherimoya, bound by prominent acidity. Be forewarned that the wine grows overripe hours after opening.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of vanilla and baking spice are followed by ample red fruit and spice flavors. The acids are tart, giving the wine a zing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Included in the blend are small portions of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, but this is Merlot with a dark side all its own. Smoke, rubber and tar highlights augment a wine with black fruits, stiff tannins and threads of licorice and sage. It's not your mama's Merlot, but it's authoritative and interesting.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine has a bouquet of raspberry, tart cherry and menthol. A medley of fruit and cooling herb flavors—in particular black cherry, cassis, mint and menthol with a hint of juniper berry—fills the mouth. Tannins are smooth and soft and the bright finish is marked with a touch of menthol.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Saucy berry aromas are accompanied by notes of coffee, olive and forest floor. This has a drawing mouthfeel, while the palate collapses a bit on itself. Flavors of raspberry and cherry offer no small amount of vanilla and oak, while the finish is lively, long and oaky. Drink through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Charred earth, underbrush, cured meat and toasted hazelnut aromas lift out of the glass. The robust palate is almost overripe, offering dried black cherry, grilled sage, tobacco and a hint of game alongside tightly packed tannins that clench the finish. Drink 2019–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A strong showing from the South Coast, this bottling offers plump red cherries, blackberries, dried plums, cocoa, shaved dark chocolate, kola nut and iron on the nose. The palate is laden with dark chocolate and cinnamon atop elderberry fruit, lifted with elderflower, lilacs and leathery tannins that drive into the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Petit Verdot, this has aromas of red currant, green bell pepper and clove. The bright palate delivers cassis, cedar and espresso framed in polished tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Bordeaux-style blend offers reserved aromas of cedar, dried herbs and cranberries, vanilla and woodspice. The dark-fruit and spice flavors are retrained and elegant, possessing a sense of balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from a blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 15% Alicante, 10% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of black currant, bell pepper and clove. The palate offers mature black cherry, ginger and a hint of vanilla while firm tannins grip the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Delicately fragrant, this opens with scents of chopped herb, elderflower, hay and citrus. On the crisp palate, a hint of vanilla underscores peach and grapefruit while a light mineral note backs up the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of honeysuckle, yellow canned peach and wet slate lead to flavors of grapefruit peel, citrus blossom and lemon zest in the mouth. The finish is crisp and zippy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blueberries and black cherries meet with rose petals, dark chocolate, brown spice and black tea on the nose of this bottling from a historic vineyard. The mouthfeel is soft with creamy tannins that grow grippier across the sip, showing cedar, black-cherry mousse, baking spice and a tinge of acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark-blue fruit, thyme, sweet barrel spices and mineral aromas lead to pitch-black fruit flavors that show the warmth of the vintage but retain their balance. The tannins provide some pucker.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Charred earth, leafy underbrush, prune marinated in spirits and grilled herbs come together in the glass. The warm, evolved palate shows blackberry jam, dried cherry, licorice and the heat of evident alcohol alongside bracing tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to soften then drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Quite dark in the glass, this is a lush rather than lithe expression of the shapeshifting grape, with bright boysenberry, black plum, uncrushed peppercorn, soy, roast beef and espresso aromas. Black pepper shows on the palate, but blueberry and blackberry fruits dominate, boosted by a touch of dark chocolate and presented with solid acidic sizzle.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tar and slightly sour black-fruit aromas show on the nose of this brooding bottling, which also has dried plum-skin qualities. Blackberry and blueberry fruits show powerfully on the palate, alongside dark chocolate and smoked-meat flavors, all tied together with a hickory-wood element.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This accessibly priced wine shows soy, black tea, boysenberry, black pepper, baked plums and lavender notes on the nose. The palate offers lilacs, rose petals and more lavender, alongside olallieberry, pencil lead and a peppery spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Grass, gooseberry and grapefruit wind their way around a light-bodied, crisp and ephemeral wine, aged mostly in stainless steel, with a small percentage in neutral French oak. Tiny bits of Sémillon and Sauvignon Musque make their way into the mix, for a wine that's textured and refreshing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 60% Prokupac and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon this Serbian wine smells of red cherry and blackberry. It is full bodied, while tasting of black cherry and blackberry. The finish is fruit filled with a touch of leather.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A stalwart, sturdy rendering, this smells like ripe plums and dark spices. It tastes full of fruit but is shaded nicely by slightly smoky, peppery notes. The body is full and the texture firm with tannins and acidity. Best drink this after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tight lemon peels and a restrained, almost chalky minerality greet the nose on this single-vineyard expression of Viognier, which also shows Gala apple, a shred of nectarine and a pinch of baking spice. A clean and pithy palate packs lemon custard, tangerine zest and grapefruit flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Softly layered in integrated oak, this 100% varietal wine dances in raspberry, citrus and leather, with a touch of tar. Full bodied, it's a reserve-level wine that may open further in the bottle and glass.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "White flowers, dried lavender and vanilla bean scent this wine. Pleasantly acidic on entry, it tastes of lemon curd, pineapple juice and white peaches. The finish is zesty and long lasting.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A big but mild-mannered wine, this has subtle oak and butter aromas plus ripe pear, butterscotch and white-peach flavors. A nicely thick texture carries all the complexity through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crisp, flinty minerality shows on the nose of this wine, before a more concentrated experience of baked apple and crème brûlée enriches the palate. Both aspects find harmony in the glass, especially on the long, textured finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This well-aged wine has a slightly earthy, new-leather aroma. Tasty, spicy flavors meet up with rich black cherry and cocoa chords to resonate through the finish. It's medium to full bodied, well balanced, moderately tannic and ready for the dinner table. The winemaker kept it in barrels for an unusual 43 months.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Juicy and smoky with a taste of tar, this full-bodied wine is soft and integrated in terms of oak. Black cherry, blackberry and strawberry play on the palate against measured acidity and weight.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light and appealing, this well-priced Willamette Valley bottling offers hints of rose petals, raspberries and thin cherry fruit. There's a whiff of sweet toast also, and the overall balance is spot on.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with aromas of pressed acacia flowers, ripe stone fruits and dried sage. The palate isn't overly sweet, offering dried apricot, wildflower honey and toasted almond notes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 83% Merlot and 17% Cabernet Sauvignon, this robust red is juicy and smoky, offering tastes of blackberry, cassis and mocha. Dusty tannins give a heaviness, accented by black licorice on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Classic varietal scents of talcum powder and rosewater lead into a tangy, tart, low alcohol but bone-dry wine. The fruit is substantial, offering solid flavors of grapefruit and lemon peel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dusty with earth and saffron aromas, this seemingly savory Silvaner is surprisingly plump and fruity on the palate. Ripe yellow plum and cherry flavors are anchored by bracing lime acidity and a moderately long, mineral finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Racy and revitalizing, this delicate off-dry Riesling balances a core of fresh white peach and citrus flavors with savory smoke and nut tones. Fresh and easy going in style, it's a likely to please a wide audience.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Affordable and appetizing, this has a lighter color and subtle smoke and toasted oak aromas. A firm texture accompanies just enough tannins and acidity, and bright red cherry and black tea flavors. It's lean in a good way, with excellent balance and a touch of austerity rather than overt richness.\n",

      "This blend of Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah grapes is so packed with flavors that they seem to stumble over each other at first. It leads with a definitely earthy aroma that fades, but then the flavors come out—effusive, chocolaty, almost sweet and definitely ripe. It is full bodied and rich in texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This perfumed, light wine has ripe fruits along with soft acidity and structure. By blending some Merlot with the Malbec, the producer has softened and broadened the tannins and allowed for attractive juicy red fruits at the end,\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Briary berry aromas come with notes of mint and oak-based vanilla scents. Earthy berry, prune and licorice flavors finish with rooty spice and mild herbal notes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is unusually rich, with a color is deeper and more yellow than the norm. Concentrated aromas suggest ripe honeydew melon and fig. The wine also has a plush mouthfeel and lingering finish. Full-bodied and flavorful, it will be happy to take the place of a Chardonnay at your next dinner.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a fruit bomb supreme. Bright, effusive strawberry, raspberry and boysenberry aromas and flavors seem to spread out in all directions, first in the aroma, then repeating in the flavors and finish. With a sip or two some deeper black cherry notes emerge, and full body and gripping tannins become more apparent.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Woodsy, cheesy, earthy aromas of berry fruits are a bit hot, jumbled and rooty in style. This is showing a mature, clampy, tannic palate with firm acidity, while earthy flavors of raspberry and plum are lightly baked. This tastes a bit raisiny on the finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Toasted oak, exotic spice and baked black fruit aromas slowly take shape on this structured Merlot. The densely extracted palate delivers coconut, blackberry extract, espresso, anisette and roasted coffee bean alongside rather astringent tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mossy, herbal, baked-berry aromas are accented by shades of green tones. On the palate, this is lively but a touch raw, with bold acidity. Blackberry, spiced plum, oak and herbal, grassy flavors finish snappy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the casual sipper of the Château de Nages rosé pair, offering slightly briny, fumé notes on the nose, but following them up with peach and melon fruit flavors that finish long, crisp and dry.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lush and creamy as soon as it hits the palate, this fine value is packed with flavors of fresh-sliced, just-ripe pear. Hints of apple and tangerine further expand the flavor, and it finishes crisp and clean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Forward, round and immediately accessible, this brings a generous mix of brambly berry, black cherry and cola to the forefront. There's a touch of dusty spice, hinting at the time spent in 21% new oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 30% Syrah, this opens with aromas of espresso, toasted oak, ground pepper, ripe black-skinned fruit and game. The extracted palate offers licorice, raisin, clove and tobacco alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish. The fruit is starting to dry up so drink sooner rather than later.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Red currant, blackberry, espresso, wood shavings and cedar aromas unfold in the glass. The palate offers dried black cherry, anise, coffee, coconut and oak alongside alongside drying tannins that leave an astringent finish. The fruit is starting to dry up so drink sooner rather than later.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In this intriguing blend, the herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc dominates the smoother Chardonnay. The wine is all about crispness and freshness with a strongly aromatic component. Acidity and a touch of minerality come through at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Distinct aromas of sizzling bacon wafts from this blend of 75% Syrah and 25% Grenache, along with smashed blackberries and a slightly reductive tar quality. The chunky palate is very meaty and smoky, with dried red cherries, espresso and asphalt elements, proving a bit rustic.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The inviting aromas of campfire smoke dominate the aromas of this wine, but there are also pressed red cherry, berry reduction sauce and roasted venison elements on the nose. The palate picks up morel mushrooms, mulberry, cranberry, smoked meats, ponzu sauce, black pepper and a bit of sour fruit, proving to be a very solid sipper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A majority of Cabernet Franc combines with 23% Cabernet Sauvignon and 23% Merlot. The result is a dense expression of cherry, strawberry and vanilla, sharp on the tongue in tar and tobacco, the tannins tightly wound.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While this has a strongly tannic structure from the Tannat in the blend, the wine is also showing its ripe fruits and generous texture. Black plum skins and blackberries give a juicy edge to this wine that will be ready to drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cherry, plum and raspberry aromas cover the red end of the aromatic spectrum. A wide, tannic, grabby body and earthy flavors of raspberry and baked plum finish bold and choppy, with freshening acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intensely acid in its youth, this bone-dry wine needs a few months. For now, it is tight and steely, very fresh and aromatic, but requires time to open out and broaden. Drink from the end of 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This vivacious white is a beach pour with class. Fresh lemon zest and floral aromas and a combination of white fruit, minerals and citrus on the palate are lively and light, but the wine has some weight behind it.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 50% Roussanne, 30% Grenache Blanc and 20% Clairette is soft in texture. A welcoming mix of ripe stone fruit and spicy nasturtium blossom finish clean and refreshing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Savory apple and lemon, earth and bramble tones persist throughout this semisweet Riesling. It's refreshingly crisp and nimble making it an easy everyday pairing for casual chicken or fish dinners at home.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This proprietary blend starts with a very gamy though thoroughly enjoyable nose of charred meat, coffee, berry and compost. On the palate, there is espresso, dried herbs and black cherry, proving to be a complex and savory yet very easy-to-like wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Seara d'Ordens is a quinta at the western end of the Douro region. This rich and polished wine is full of black fruits, with herbal overtones and layers of wood aging that have left espresso flavors. With this concentration, the wine needs to age for several years; drink after 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Honey and lemon accent the nose and palate of this stately flagship wine from Sparkling Pointe. Extended lees aging lends remarkable depth and complexity—shades of brioche and almond add a richness on the palate. Revitalizing acidity and a train of tiny bubbles lead to a soft, pillowy foam.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Slightly green, minty aromas of tobacco, spice, purple flower and sawdust filter onto a structured, lively palate. Flavors of dark berry fruits are accented by mint, coffee and chocolate, while the finish hits with controlled heat and herbal berry flavors. Drink this Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère blend through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a lightly aromatic wine, with notes of lees, apple, mineral and spice. It's medium bodied, with a thick, textured feel showing good weight and intensity to the fruit flavors alongside well-balanced acidity. A uniquely styled wine without an easy comparison in the region.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the acclaimed Champoux vineyard, this puts the purple fruit in a wrap of pretty baking spices. Barrel aging adds cocoa and coffee, while the acidity is sufficient to keep the wine from feeling too tannic. Another couple of years of bottle age—or brisk decanting—should put it at its peak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "On the nose, this blend is leathery and earthy. Bold berry and cassis flavors on the palate are amplified by strong notes of baking spice and chocolate, while the finish is oaky and shows moderate complexity. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From vines farmed by Neumeyer for the local Hospices de Molsheim charity, this intense wine has a ripe character that is already rounding out its acidity. With minerality from the chalk soil, it's complex and will develop over several years. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An elegant, poised wine that's bone dry, nervy and lightly fruity. The wine is balanced between its fresh acidity and ripe fruitiness. With its bright texture, it's a wine that needs food. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Medium sweet in character, this is a rich wine that's driven by its rich terroir. The chalk and gravel soil of the Goldert vineyard produces great spiciness that is balanced by delicate acidity and the possibility of aging further. Drink now, but it will be better from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine has a golden character, warm and ripe. Its rich fruits bring out honeydew melon and pineapple as well as crisper orange zest. The structure and the rich texture are already all there, although it will develop well until 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lean and crisp, this light, ethereal Chardonnay develops in the glass into something more substantial and complex. Herbal and slightly savory, it intrigues and will be a nice companion to fresh green salads in a light vinaigrette.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Like a bouquet made of different types of flowers, this polished wine brings diverse elements into a pleasing whole. There are ripe tropical fruit, vanilla and butter aromas, rich apple and pear flavors, a soothing smooth texture and lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A very aromatic wine, showing notes of orange marmalade, brown sugar and apricot. It's supremely rich, with a mango and honey filled finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of cherry and vanilla continue to the palate alongside notes of toffee, smoked meat and roasted red pepper. A well-balanced wine, with flavors that are equal parts fruity and savory, the finish boasts lingering tannins and bright acidity. Fine Terroir Selections, Misa Imports.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich and meaty enough to sink your teeth into, this dark and deep Syrah has toasty, smoky aromas. Generous blackberry and boysenberry flavors that are full but not sweet accompany a velvety texture. This is tasty now, but has the layered tannins and acidity for aging. Best now through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From an estate vineyard high atop Mount Veeder, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is dark and inky, concentrated in color and flavor, a brambly intensity at the center of it all. Peppercorns and clove accent its larger smoky, espresso side, the body full and velvety.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A ripe, tannic and herbal wine, this has been produced for aging. It shows a dark tannic side over the juicy black plum fruits and berry flavors. The wood aging shows in the way the wine smoothes out at the end, leaving a rich, full-bodied aftertaste. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The grapes are Demeter-certified Biodynamic in this 100% Zin, grown on a ridge-top vineyard overlooking the Dry Creek Valley. A fully realized, satisfying wine, it offers cherry vanilla, tar and toasty bacon among warm tones of complementary spicy cinnamon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Warmed croissant yeastiness matches up with sea salt and lemon butter on the nose of this bottling from the pioneering Santa Barbara Winery. The salinity carries on the palate, with apple pie and butterscotch presenting a nicely oaked but not overdone palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a delicious Chardonay. It dances in pear, peach and lemon notes. Balanced and addictive, it's easy to love and not overly complicated at all. Encased in just enough oak to provide texture and weight, this is a great wine for parties or casual dinners, pairable with just about anything.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is rich, medium sweet and intensely aromatic and spicy. A spicily hot character derives from the pepper, bergamot and cardamom flavors. At the back are a firm structure and tropical fruits. Age this wine and don't drink before 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Brown calls this wine its Cab lover's Zin, blending 60% Zinfandel with Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah. It is a stunner, sultry in juicy red plum, cassis, currant and earthy tobacco. Tannins are soft and leathery, and all the varieties are well represented.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very rich, this ripe and rounded wine is typical of the powerful 2010 vintage. It's dense and concentrated, packed with black plum and sweet berry fruits. It shows a dense structure along with juicy fruits. It could be over the top, but the acidity and tannins hold it back. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A wine that is rich in both tannins and ripe fruit. The 45% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend gives the concentration of the wine, with spice and black berry fruits that are given an extra richness by the intense dark plums. The wine needs aging, so drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very concentrated, beautifully ripe and blackberrylike in flavor, this abounds with goodness from the grapes rather than woody flavors from barrels. The sweet-seeming fruit flavors come without a lot of tannin to dry the texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offers the classic Nebbiolo fragrance of blue flower, red rose, woodland berry, tilled earth and whiffs of cake spices. The palate delivers ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry and white pepper framed in big, chewy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While the wine is all tannin and structure at this stage, the weight and rich fruit promise plenty of good aging potential. Wine producers for 10 generations, the Dulon family picks specific plots. This 60% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet France blend has juicy black fruits that will push forward to give a full wine with a fine presence. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's been no price increase for this outstanding value, but the quality keeps going up and up. It's packed with juicy red berry and cassis fruit—supple, tangy, deep and lingering. The finish carries a suggestion of chalk, more in the sense of minerality than any artificial dryness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of five different varieties with Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah making up 70% of the mix, it brings intriguing notes of cranberry, raspberry jam and fruit leather. The palate is full bodied with rich dried cherry flavors and firm tannins that need time in the cellar to soften.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Although the wine is dry, it has a wonderfully aromatic, honeyed character. That follows through to the rich, full palate, giving a wine that tastes of dried apricots and quince. Full-bodied, it should be drunk in a year.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A warm wine that shows rich flavors, ripe acidity and plenty of yellow fruits. It is rounded, smooth and likely to develop quickly. The acidity at the end is the crisp contrast to this full, forward wine. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Melon and apple fruit flavors are lightly buttery, fresh and spicy. The underlying minerality adds textural interest to this light, elegant and stylish offering.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Heady varietal aromas recall crushed tomato vine, cantaloupe and gooseberries. The vibrant palate delivers juicy pineapple, mango and green melon along with a spicy ginger note, all brightened with refreshing acidity that ends clean and crisp. Oliver McCrum, T. Edward Wines.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It opens with aromas of sun-ripened berries, spearmint and Mediterranean scrub. The palate offers dark cherry and raspberry accented with notes of white pepper and a hint of cinnamon-spice alongside round tannins. It's ripe, soft and ready to enjoy soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It opens with a floral fragrance of peach blossom and white spring flowers. The juicy, vibrant palate delivers ripe golden apple, mineral and almond notes alongside crisp acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This full-bodied wine begins with delicate aromas of toasted bread crust, mature pear and Golden Delicious apple. The palate delivers ripe yellow peach, papaya, lemon zest, white almond and mineral alongside brisk acidity. Drink now for crispness or hold another year or two for more complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Difficult to appreciate now, this Pinot is bone dry, brittle in tannins and acidic. It has quietly complex rosehip tea, sour cherry candy and cola flavors, with a tasteful appliqué of oak. Hold until 2019 and see what it's doing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Structured and sophisticated, it offers creamy green apple, pear, citrus and white peach sensations. The juicy fruit palate is restrained by subtle notes of white pepper and mineral alongside fresh acidity that leaves a focused, lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This rich, wood-aged wine abounds with spice and ripe pear, peach and mango fruits. The dense texture comes from aging on the lees for four months, adding to the richness and spicy character. Drink this wine now, but it will be better in 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Reflecting the structure and fruit of the 2010 vintage, the wine has dry tannins that are balanced by juicy black fruits and fine acidity. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A perfumed, wood-aged wine, this is rich, full of fruit and structure, and obviously worth aging. Almost equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon have produced an aromatic wine packed with black currant fruit and dark tannins. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is so light, it tastes like raspberry foam, with a dash of cola and a dusting of cocoa. This is thoroughly delicious and delicate, but sustaining. A lovely, elegant effort that captures the essence of this light vintage without sacrificing detail, length or flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An elegant Alvarinho from the north of the Vinho Verde region. It has some wood aging, rounding out the acidity of the fruit and introducing a spiced orange and lime character, full-bodied and ripe. It could age until 2015, but is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Woody, smoky notes belie the intensely fruity palate of this medium-sweet Rieslaner. A cross of Riesling and Sylvaner, it carries out the traits of its parents faithfully—aromatic and peachy, yet intensely herbaceous and grassy too. It finishes long, with a streak of sunny, lemon acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dusty mineral and saffron notes add intensity and spice to superripe, sunny peach and yellow cherry aromas on this semisweet Riesling. It's lavishly fruity on the palate, but layered, with earthy complexity. It finishes long, with a delicately honeyed sweetness that lingers.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deeply concentrated, with honeyed yellow-peach and tangerine flavors, this is a gorgeously composed wine, with just a hint of sweetness for balance. Notes of cherry blossom and crushed minerals add complexity and depth. It finishes long, with a delicate, lacy sweetness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Zesty evergreen and herb notes lend freshness to notes of Meyer lemon and nectarine in this delicate Riesling. The palate builds in floral, fruity intensity, with bright peach and blossom notes. Delicately sweet yet brisk in lemony acidity, with a long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This barrel-fermented blend—split equally between the two varieties—displays notes of marzipan, melon, tropical fruit and biscuit. It's medium-plus bodied, with a lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Whiffs of earth and musk add a dark complexity to sweet peach and blossom aromas on this superconcentrated spätlese. On the palate, unctuous marmalade is laced with saffron and honey, finishing long and with a streak of tangerine acidity and a murmur of astringency.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This medium-bodied and elegant Pinot Bianco boasts fragrances of white spring flowers, green apple and flint that carry over to the savory palate.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a tannic while richly fruity wine, showing ripe warm-climate Cabernet Sauvignon flavors. Blackberries and dusty tannins are to the fore, giving a firm structure, fine juiciness and a dense texture. The wine could age, so drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made in the rich, buttery style, this decadent Chardonnay oozes honey, butterscotch, tropical fruit, vanilla and toast flavors. It also has a much-needed minerality that adds depth and firmness. The grapes come from Carneros, Oakville and St. Helena. Drink through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is already a delicious wine with its hints of yellow fruits, soft minerality and creamy texture. There is a touch of toast, warm fruitiness and fresh acidity. It's ready to drink now, but will age until 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Preserved quince and honeyed apple flavors are accented by streaks of mineral and lime zest on this elegant off-dry Riesling. Tart green apple and fresh herb notes lift the midpalate. It finishes long, but crisp and refreshing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A big wine, tannic and extracted in blackberry, blueberry and red currant flavors, with notes of bacon, mocha, black pepper and sandalwood. It shows plenty of class, but is still too young. Give until 2017 in the cellar.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It's hard to believe there's no oak on this wine, with its accents of vanilla and buttered toast. The wine was fermented in stainless steel and bottled earlywith no barrel exposure. It's beautifully rich in tropical fruit, pear, peach and lime flavors, with a brisk amount of acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Almost instantly identifiable as a Napa Valley Cabernet for its classic black currant and cassis flavors, wrapped into sturdy tannins, and finished with acidity. The fruit is ripe and sweet, with an edge of green olives, yet the finish is thoroughly dry, with a complex spiciness. Drink now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Call this Zin lusty, huge, gigantic, massive, anything that describes scale. Some Zins like this are over the top, but this one maintains a precarious balance, despite high alcohol and superripe raisin and dark chocolate flavors. With firm tannins, it's classic Monte Rosso Zinfandel, and will age for decades.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A savory blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of scorched earth, meat juices, leather, black fruit and spices. The dense, low-acid palate delivers black currants and fleshy black cherry accented with black pepper and mocha alongside soft, round tannins. Drink now through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A laundry list of a blend, this combines Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Viognier. Medium in body, it features flavors of cherry, strawberry and flower, plus juicy acids that thrust the wine across the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lychee and melon aromas are proper for Torrontés. And while this has Viognier and Chardonnay in the blend, it's Torrontés that dominates via a spritzy, citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of lychee, nectarine and citrus fruits. A fresh, lively but simple finish confirms the wine's refreshment potential.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big, oaky and concentrated, it's rich in coffee and leathery toffee, the tannins firm and feisty.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Funky aromas soon burn off to reveal oak, coffee, espresso and vanilla sensations. The palate also shows a heavy wood influence, displaying oak extract and vanilla alongside plum and black cherry. It finishes on an astringent note of drying tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark berry, sous bois and pastry spice aromas lead to a medium- to full-bodied palate that exhibits easy acids and fixed, chalky tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Oak, toast, coffee, espresso, chocolate and vanilla sensations dominate this wine along with notes of black plum. It lacks fruit richness to balance the oak and the astringent wood tannins on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Subtle aromas of minerals, rose petal and red berry are not overdone. In the mouth, it has astringency, hard tannins and an overall narrow feel. Flavors of raspberry and red plum seem sharp and jagged, while oaky mint and heat rise up on the finish. Give this more bottle time and it may improve.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a wine that shows a more serious side to Vinho Verde. Bone dry, with a crisp and creamy texture, it has citrus, pineapple and red apple flavors. It could even age a few months, but is so drinkable now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh plum and berry aromas are cut from a common mold. This is a good but typical juicy Rioja with clean fruit, crisp acidity and nice cherry and raspberry flavors. A touch of bitterness comes up at the tail end of the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a well-constructed, with 95% of the grapes from Napa Valley and the rest supplied from nearby Lake County. Merlot makes up 85% of the wine; the remainder is Cabernet Sauvignon. Hearty, it offers juicy plum and black cherry as well as streaks of cedar and black pepper. The tannins are soft and integrated while the finish hints at mocha and chocolate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Snappy, dry red-fruit and citrus aromas are a good opening. The palate is fresh and bouncy, with punchy pomegranate and grapefruit flavors. A zesty finish with mild citrus and nectarine flavors is par for the course.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A feral, oaky Pinot Noir from cool-climate vineyards that tastes of just-ripe cherry and raspberry fruit, with a distinct smokiness on the nose.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lemon, lychee and a slight oily character create a familiar Torrontés bouquet. A plump body is balanced by citrusy acidity, while flavors of tangerine, mango, passion fruit and lychee finish a touch heavy but vertical. Drink right away.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a finely made, easy to drink wine. It is soft, round, with spice and light tannins, a wine that would travel to parties, barbecues and pasta bakes. The acidity from the blackberry flavor keeps it fresh and fruity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Saucy, scratchy aromas suggest road tar and compost. This wine is wide in feel, with peppery, spicy raspberry and plum flavors. A minty, herbal tasting finish is neither overbearing nor oaky.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sanguine and brawny, it's concentrated in dark plum and blueberry fruit, with an earthy element teasing around the edges. The finish is marked by power and grip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose isn't very expressive but eventually reveals fig and raisin aromas. The simple palate offers raw, red cherry alongside brisk acidity and firm tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lighter in color, this wine comes from the Miller family that owns Bien Nacido Vineyard. Aromas combine brisk raspberry and fresh strawberry with clove. There is a bitterness on the palate akin to sautéed beet greens, followed by pepper spice and more raspberry, with tannins that may evolve over time.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "On first sniff, this shows Viognier's lean side, offering notes of kiwis and lemons. Letting the wine sit in the glass helps to lure out the grape's characteristic scents of exotic flowers, apricots and peaches. A fresh, easygoing selection, this concludes with a clean, medium-length finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an expansive, fuller-style of Chardonnay from windswept Carneros. Juicy in apple and Meyer lemon, it's softly textured, with a pronounced richness in aroma, evocative of earthy oak and petrol. Mouthfilling and creamy, it finishes with a taste of crème caramel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This structured, young wine has good acidity along with black currant fruitiness and firm tannins that need time to soften. The aftertaste, with its lift of freshness is already attractive. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This brooding Barolo opens with aromas of crushed black fruit, leather and balsamic notes. The palate displays oak extract, espresso, black licorice, toast and coffee alongside extremely astringent wood tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a bone dry Vinho Verde, very crisp and tight. It has the freshest sliced apple and lime flavors that are both refreshing and invigorating. From high, cool vineyards, this is a fine wine that would benefit from a few more months in bottle.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This delivers cedary, smoky aromas and tasty plum and berry flavors. There's a good balance between mild tannins, firm acidity and moderately rich fruit character. Nothing over the top, all in proportion.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mature plum, espresso, coffee and oak aromas emerge on this young and still rather closed Barolo. The palate delivers black cherry, vanilla and cocoa alongside aggressive tannins that leave the mouth feeling parched. Drink after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "On the slopes above the river Garonne, this vineyard has produced a fresh and fruity wine. Firm tannins are balanced by the intensely young and juicy berry fruit. Wood aging rounds the corners of this wine that will be drinkable from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With some years under its belt, this has become a ripe, full and smooth wine. It shows attractive acidity as well as some firm tannins, but these fit well into the juicy black plum fruits and fresh aftertaste. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine shows a tropical fruit character, with apricots and mangos laced by more citrus and lime acidity. It's rich, warm and round, although at the back a steely tautness provides balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A softly textured, fruity wine that has a feeling of richness. Apricot fruits are balanced by lime crispness. Full and ripe, it's ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aged in neutral oak barrels with malolactic fermentation, this medium yellow-colored wine brings notes of wheat cereal, peach and lees. It's dry and broad in feel with tart acidity, seeming slightly advanced for its age.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This smells a touch stalky and leathery, although there's ample black fruit character to the bouquet. A tannic somewhat rough palate holds stalky flavors of roasted black fruits, charred wood and creosote. A jagged finish with peppery spice and heat closes this out. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While bright cherry and berry aromatics take a bit of aeration and coaxing to flourish, this four-square wine calibrates juicy primary red fruit with cool touches of menthol and cranberry acidity. It's approachably fruity and framed in soft delicate tannins. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with attractive aromas of pressed rose, woodland berry, dried herb and a whiff of baking spice. The robust palate shows sour, almost unripe cherry, clove, mocha and anisette. The warmth of evident alcohol closes the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The 2012 and 2013 vintages were both strong in southern Australia, so some of the realistically priced Pinots from South Australia and Victoria are worth stocking up on. This is a good example, showing hints of acacia blossoms, red berries, cola and brown sugar wrapped in supple tannins. Drink now through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Forest floor, woodland berry and spice aromas emerge in the glass. The tight palate offers sour cherry, white pepper, grilled herb and a whiff of tobacco alongside close-grained tannins and racy acidity. An anisette note closes the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cherry and plum aromas are dry, earthy and direct. This is a straightforward aged Rioja with grabby tannins but enough body and fruit to absorb them. Baked cherry and plum flavors are a touch rustic and stalky, while a roasted aftertaste sends this on its way. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Primary aromas of black cherry and cassis come with minerally notes, herbal hints and a drop of iodine. This feels good but narrow, while saucy, lightly herbal berry flavors end with tolerable saltiness. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of scorched earth, underbrush, red berry and a whiff of cellar floor lead the nose. On the firm palate, ground pepper, tobacco and sage accent sour cherry while brooding tannins offer firm support.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Warm and robust, this full-bodied Barolo offers aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, tar and kirsch. The palate is bold and hearty but also shows the heat of the vintage, doling out cherry-marinated-in-spirits, licorice and clove alongside almost scorching alcohol. Drink sooner rather than later.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This fruit-forward, elegant wine offers gentle flavors of strawberry and cherry, with a lightly candied aspect. It's like a cherry lollipop, with a lingering, slightly earthy finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A chalky slightly saline minerality extends through this lemony fresh wine, accenting plush fruity flavors of apple, peach and pear. It's silky on the palate and refreshing in composure, ideal for elegant and casual entertaining.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Woody blackberries meet with freshly plucked violets and lilacs on the snappy nose of this wine. The palate shows very tart berry fruit, but is driven more so by the asphalt and peppercorn elements.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This full-bodied wine smells ripe and buttery, like a pear tart, and has similar tasty flavors like ripe apple, vanilla and cream. Though it's not technically sweet, the personality is generous and the texture soft and rich.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of baked plum, cherry under spirits, oak and coconut lead the nose while the polished palate offers ripe black cherry, vanilla, grilled herb and a hint of licorice. Firm, fine-grained tannins support the savory flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Considerable noble rot both in its aromas and in its palate give this wine richness and a textured, sweet and dry character. Honeyed with bitter marmalade and dried apricot flavors , it is still young. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "White peach and apple blossoms perfume this dancingly brisk Silvaner. Crisp nectarine and lime penetrate the palate, along with a refreshing sheen of minerality that extends the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Racy and tight, this exuberant Riesling sekt juxtaposes fresh lemon and blossom notes against a piercing backbone of acidity. Tiny, persistent bubbles and delicate foam wrap up briskly on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The color of oxblood, this meaty, tannic wine pours espresso, black licorice and composted earth around tart blackberry fruit. It's aromatic, spicy and nicely balanced.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This deep-colored, rich-tasting and thick-textured blend does a fine imitation of a more expensive red. Made with a majority of Merlot, its dark cherry and dark chocolate flavors blend well in a texture of fine-grained tannins and firm acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This tight and steely wine is fresh with crisp fruits and a strongly herbaceous character. It offers gooseberry, grapefruit and intense, youthful acidity that needs to calm down. Give this very young wine until the end of 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas that recall stewed prune, cherry steeped in spirits, baking spice, toast and a whiff of menthol lead the nose and carry through to the firm palate along with notes of coffee, grilled sage and clove. Bracing tannins provide the framework. Give this a few more years to unwind then drink up. Best after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The red juiced Alicante Bouschet has produced a powerful and generous wine that's rich and full of southern sun as well as dark black fruits. It is concentrated and impressive with its ripe flavors. Foot-trodden in open fermenters, it is full and generous needing to age until 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It's difficult to find $20 Pinot Noir this good from anywhere in the world. Floral notes on the nose yield to ripe black-cherry fruit on the palate, which finish finishes with crisp acids and soft, dusty tannins. Drink now–2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright floralilty greets the nose on this bottling, which shows lime and grapefruit blossom as well as a lighter nectarine flesh. The palate is restrained and grippy, a tart take on the varietal, with lime sorbet, lemon peel and yellow-grapefruit flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Classic Nebbiolo aromas of violet, wild berry and a whiff of baking spice float out of the glass on this attractive red. The elegantly structured palate offers mature wild cherry, cinnamon, white pepper and clove alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017–2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark and dense, this opens with aromas of ripe plum, vanilla and exotic spice. The round, chewy palate offers ripe black cherry, blackberry, roasted coffee bean, licorice and clove alongside close-grained tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Nicely textural, this propels its black-cherry fruit into a tasty finish. The wine spent 16 months in French oak, yielding grace notes of coffee grounds, cola and a dash of mocha.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Charcoal aromas shadow standard black fruit scents. This is forward in its approach, with a sturdy mouthfeel. Black plum and blackberry flavors feature a lot of vanilla and cream, while the finish is mild, straightforward and tastes mostly like oak and associated vanilla. Drink now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This single-vineyard cuvée brings bold red fruit backed with steely minerality. After 14 months in 50% new French oak, the barrel flavors remain unintrusive, allowing pretty aromas of roses, raspberries, cherries and chocolate to emerge. It's drinking well already, and should continue to shine through 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Alluring aromas of rose, iris, menthol and woodland berry waft out of the glass. The straightforward, polished palate offers ripe cherry, black raspberry, white pepper and star anise alongside fine-grained tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hints of woodruff and green pear play on the nose and lead to a fresh, crisp, slender palate. This is an easy-drinking, soft but fresh summer wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with earthy aromas of brimstone, scorched soil, hay, orchard fruit and dried herb. The palate offers pink grapefruit, white stone fruit, sage and a marked saline note that creates a briny mineral finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A subdued nose leads to a fresh but also subdued palate, but if you look for the ripe pear notes you will find them. This wine takes time to wake up and breathe but underneath it's an archetypal fresh but rounded Alsace Pinot Blanc.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Scented impressions of ripe pear and aloe vera pervade this wine. The palate shows texture and more fruit than you might expect from slender Sylvaner. The finish is brisk, clean and taut.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The spare red fruit seems set in stone. The AVA's characteristic sub-flavors of concrete and dry stone are on full display. The wine remains tightly wound, with crisp definition. This should benefit from another couple of years in bottle. It finishes with plenty of acid and chalk.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A 50-50 blend of Nero d'Avola and Frappato, this opens with funky aromas of game, overripe berry and a hint of barnyard. Bursting with rustic charm, the aromas carry over to the earthy palate along with fleshy black cherry, soft raspberry, cake spice and crushed black olive.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This red-fruit-dominated Garnacha smells of earthy cherry and plum along with orange peel. A racy, chewy, slightly rough palate of pie cherry, red plum, raisin and chocolate finish juicy and aggressive.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raspberry aromas are a touch candied, wiry and suggest a twist of orange peel. Chunky and with hard tannins, this tastes of cherry, cassis and baking spices. It holds firm on the finish, with warmth and a note of brown sugar.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Punchy citrus and minerally aromas open this fresh SB. A juicy, citric palate points in the right direction, while this tastes like tangerine and orange peel mixed with lime and green herbs. A crisp, persistent finish closes it out.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With a slight addition of Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine features brushy black cherry and raspberry around a full-bodied, quite-ripe core that rides the palate softly and succulently. Bright and herbal, it has a mellow finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Black cherry and cassis aromas are bold but basic. This feels fiercely tannic and astringent. Meaty flavors of cherry and black plum end with dried berry notes, prune and rock-hard tannic bite. Give this more time if possible, but like many 2013s it might never soften and improve.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of beeswax, yellow spring flower and botanical herb blend together. The young, vibrant palate offers lemon, lime, green apple and mineral. It's still a very young wine and needs time to come together. Drink 2018 through 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very light and summery on the nose, this bottling shows aromas of yellow melon, green pear, lime blossoms, lime juice and a touch of chalk. Wet rocks, cut garden herbs and green apple skins emerge on the refreshing palate, which is perfect for sunny days and shellfish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe aromas of honey, yellow peach, brown pear and a nearly marshmallow character show on the nose of this bottling from the Carmel Valley. It's surprisingly very dry on the palate, where mouth-watering acidity offers plush nectarine and browned apple fruit flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "White spring flower, pear and a whiff of exotic fruit lead the way. The floral note carries over to the medium-bodied palate, along with lemon, lime, peach and a note of bitter almond. Fresh acidity brightens the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tight and fresh aromas of Asian pear, honeysuckle and key lime pie converge on this sparkler from a new estate in Temecula. The palate shows sliced apples, yellow pears, ripe nectarine, rounder white peach and even creamy cherimoya flavors. Though the region is known more for almond-flavored sparklers, they seem to do regular bubbles well.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Vanilla and caramel show right away on the nose of this bottling, followed by stewed blackberry and black plum sauce, proving quite jammy but layered with burnt sugar aromas. Blackberry pie in a vanilla crust is the flavor that pops on the palate, along with black plum and all manner of purple fruit and flower.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoke and dark-inflected notes of espresso and cacao are front and center, wrapping into the core of cassis. Hints of prune and coffee liqueur complement chewy tannins, that lend further substance and depth. This punches well above the listed alcohol.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intensely perfumed, this wine has soft tannins and a smooth, red-fruit-dominated texture. From a 3.5-acre premier-cru vineyard, it is ripe while light in character, suggesting it will age smoothly and quickly. The wine is almost ready now, although it will be best from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Rara Neagra, Shiraz and Malbec, this Moldovan wine has aromas of sweet cherry juice and vanilla. It has flavors of dried figs, fresh black plum and dried red plums. The finish is persistent with grippy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dense, earthy, herbal aromas of berry fruits and black plum feed into a racy, structured palate with high acidity. Spicy, herbal berry and plum flavors taste a bit salty, while this is plenty woody on an herbal, dry, fresh finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Straw yellow in color, this widely available wine offers vanilla, lemon curd, honeysuckle and a touch of browned butter on the nose. Once sipped, seared lemon and yellow apple show first, settling into a vanilla cream groove and finishing on a touch of marshmallow.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a softly textured, well-made cool-climate-inspired Rhône red, lean and layered in companionable blue fruit, whiffs of violet and white pepper and a touch of gamey meat. Unfiltered and grown on the producer's estate, it flirts with oak without ever entirely giving in to it.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark strawberries, rose buds, black plums, sweet cedar, tangy herbs and oodles of dark fruit pour off the nose of this wine, which is leveled by 13% Syrah. Bursting acidity frames the palate alongside red currants, peppercorns, dill and black olive. It's slightly less dense in style than other Mourvèdres.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright, moderately complex aromas of stone fruits and minerals precede a firm, lemony palate with familiar, highly fresh tangerine and nectarine flavors. This holds its form and snap on the finish. Drink during 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Initially closed, a few swirls of the glass releases subtle scents suggesting Spanish Broom, linden blossom, flint and a whisper of orange zest. While the palate is less expressive than the nose, it still offers yellow apple, citrus and mineral alongside crisp acidity. It's still very immature and needs additional time to age.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Subtle yellow flower and orchard fruit aromas blend while the linear palate offers pear, citrus zest, a hint of oak and mineral. Fresh acidity gives it a crisp, clean finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A bit shy on the nose, this appellation-blend bottling shows light cola, red cherry and wet slate aromas. The palate is tightly wound and very earthy, with turned loam, strong wet clay, oregano, sage, pomegranate and hibiscus elements all playing together nicely.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offers aromas of scorched earth, underbrush and a whiff of oak. The firm palate offers sour cherry, fleshy strawberry, toast, coconut and espresso alongside assertive, close-grained tannins that leave a mouth-drying finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose is secretive but the palate shows structure and poise. There is freshness and brisk, tart redcurrant fruit with some concentration, plesantly unexpected grip and lovely firmness. It's a light but impressive Pinot.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine defines luxurious texture, at once velvety, richly layered and bright. From one of the warmer sites in a cool climate zone, it complements its fruit concentration with deeper sarsaparilla, vanilla, tea and cardamom scents, the finish delightfully playful in orange peel accents.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Coming from this exceptional winery the term reserve (or in this case, riservata) actually means a great deal. Flavors are broad and deep and entwined with plum, cherry compote, soy and chocolate. The length and power are impressive: these flavors just don't quit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The heady scent of grapefruit and tangelo peel immediately add savoriness to the crisp green-apple fruit that is evident on the nose. But there are also richer hints of honey and yellow apple. The palate remains taut, slender and linear but that tangelo spice is boosted by enticing herbal notes of yarrow and a dollop of yeast. This is an aromatic marvel. The finish is dry and intense. This will keep your interest for years. Drink now through 2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Cabernet equivalent to Grange has exploded in price (I remember tasting the 1996 on release when it was $25 per bottle), but there's no questioning the quality. A deep, intense nose of cassis, earth, menthol and cedar is followed by a full, rich palate that's supple without being soft. Brighter notes of red fruit emerge on the lengthy finish, which is dominated by sweet fruit and creamy lactones. Drink 2020–2030, and probably well beyond.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A perennial standout, this Syrah is cofermented with 10% Viognier, all fruit sourced from a site on the western edge of Sonoma Mountain in the cool confines of the Petaluma Gap. Beautiful and bold, it imparts a focused line of blackberry and lavender flavors over a lush backdrop of sizzling acidity and smoked meat scents.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The full tilt of ripe peach hits the nose at once, followed by glimpses of marmalade and peach compote. The palate follows with the same aromatic intensity, enriching the peach compote notes even further with lemony barley sugar and fresh caramel, pierced by tangy citrus acidity. The flavors are mature and precise, opulent but tempered, and have a decadent touch. This is lovely now but has the concentration and drive to evolve. Drink now through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "From an organic, dry farmed vineyard, this wine is as feral as the forest—a study in wild boar, wildflowers and dried herbs. Bright acidity buoys that meaty quality in the form of tart rhubarb and strawberry tea flavors. Floral on the nose and palate, it's spicy too, with bold seasonings of clove and pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Certain wines exude a sense of elevated excellence. This one gets to that level via aromas of spice cake, baked plum and tobacco aromas. A stocky saturated palate is structured and built to age, while this tastes of cool blue fruits, herbs, coffee and chocolate. A smoothly textured finish deals cocoa and mocha notes. Drink through 2040.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a beautifully perfumed wine. With a high proportion of ripe Cabernet Franc, it is not only structured but has a fine dried fruit character that gives the wine a memorable richness. The wine is tight with its tannins, likely to age over decades. Drink from 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Initial tight acidity in this crisp wine gives way to smooth rich black fruits. This already has a fine balance with its ripe juiciness and delicious red-berry flavors. It is going to develop into a very fine wine. Drink from 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is something very pure and lifted about this: right now it is so taut that it just says citrus and stone. There is something both ripe and tart, a very lemon-like freshness, with generosity and fruit. There is unusual concentration and for now, while the aromas are still tightly wound, the absolutely stony serious texture is on full display. The purity of this is astonishing and has something authentic and enticing about it. Give this time. Drink 2020–2040.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine shows the success of white wines in the 2014 vintage. Initially it has lively acidity and a crisp texture. Then the palate fills out with complex citrus, pineapple and apricot flavors. The aftertaste—juicy and tangy—is already delicious. Drink from 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a perfumed ripe wine, packed with generous tannins that still give a style and elegance that is a remove from the older overripe style of Pavie. It is balanced, complex and with great potential. The wood and the tannins are in harmony with the black fruits. With its structure, it will certainly age well. Drink from 2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bottling comes from the best blocks and barrels from this single vineyard, co-owned by a number of Edna Valley luminaries. The result is stunning, with baked raspberry, strawberry, maple, and peppery bacon aromas comprising a spicy, exotic nose. Black plum fruit melds with white pepper and crushed herbs, diving into tangy strawberry and sandalwood incense notes on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From vines planted in 1912, this has been an icon of South Australia Shiaz since 1952, when it was first bottled as a single-vineyard wine. Menthol and vanilla notes frame black cherries and cassis on the nose, while the palate reveals supple tannins and meaty, savory complexities. The finish is softly dusty, fine and long. Drink now–2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This beautiful wine further confirms the high level of quality in the Pinot Noirs from Dan Goldfield and Steve Dutton. It has a profusion of ripe black cherry and currant flavors, backed by firm acidity and fine-grained tannins, giving it grip. Its balance of concentrated fruit flavors and solid structure indicates a long life in the cellar. Best after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This powerful ripe wine has firm tannins that are so well integrated. With acidity and with rich black fruit, the wine is concentrated and dense. From a small parcel on the slope of Saint-Emilion, it is a wine to age for many years. Drink from 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a throwback to those brash, flavor-exuding Aussie wines of the past. Flashy, sweet-scented oak (think maple syrup and toasted coconut) marks the nose, while concentrated cassis and vanilla flavors coat the palate. This is big, but gorgeously so, with velvety-rich tannins and a long, plush finish. No, there's nothing subtle about this blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Shiraz, but sometimes subtlety is overrated. Drink now–2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This rich, opulent wine carries its massive oak load easily, marrying vanilla and toasted coconut notes with ripe plum and black cherry flavors. It's full bodied and plush, with supple tannins supported by the wood. Give it a few years to knit together and drink it 2020–2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A lovely heady note of citrus peel and moss hovers above the crisp apple notes of the nose. The bone-dry palate is taut, streaked with absolute lemon freshness and very, very pure. This is linear and totally toned, majoring in the tart and invigorating end of the citrus spectrum. All the more excitement for us. Notions of wet stone pop up and remain on the palate. This is refreshing now but will absolutely reward patience. Drink from 2020 through 2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "You could get lost in the enticing fragrance of this wine thanks to wild berry, blue flower, baking spice, chopped herb and saddle leather aromas. The smooth, elegantly structured palate is just as inviting, doling out juicy black cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and white pepper flavors. Polished tannins and fresh acidity lend balance and support. An impressive effort from this winery—one of Montalcino's little known gems.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From an estate vineyard planted high atop the Sebastopol Hills near Freestone, this wine impresses from start to finish. It shows unique white pepper and floral aromas, while a seamless texture supports its succulent cranberry and cherry flavors, a long, lingering accent of nutmeg spice rounding out the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is powered both by its tannins and by its great fruit. Dark and dense both in the structure and the black-plum flavors, it is very fine wine– juicy and ripe. This is a serious wine with a great future. Drink from 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The lifted nose seems like an amalgam of chalk and dried apples along with lemon zest. The aromas are reminiscent of evolving Riesling but this is not the only grape in this expressive and highly aromatic field blend. While there is distinct residual sweetness on the palate, this has a counterweight in the rich texture of the midpalate. There is something authentic and deeply comforting and satisfying at the core of this wine that says Alsace. It's impossible to put this wine into a box, it needs to be tasted and enjoyed on its very own terms. The finish is medium sweet, totally soil-driven and very, very long. This is an experience rather than a drink. Drink now through 2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is just a touch of peach amidst the green and yellow apple notes. The palate adds a stony earthy touch, as well as a hint of lanoline, and has an impressive core of fruit that radiates throughout this wine with pure apple flavor and crisp freshness. This strikes a high soprano note of absolute purity. The body is taut and bone-dry, the finish is clean and lasting. Gorgeous now but totally built to last. Drink now through 2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a selection of the original vines at this heritage vineyard, which was planted in the early 1970s, this is densely layered with strawberry, raspberry and cherry fruit. Details are well-integrated, bringing light notes of toasted coconut and caramel. The texture and mouthfeel express the little extras that old vines, when handled properly, can deliver.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a Westside Road-adjacent vineyard in the heart of the northern Middle Reach, Flax is rocky and the vines a decade old. Expect luxurious power and a velvety mouthfeel from this wine, its black tea, pomegranate and rhubarb flavors brushed with allspice, sage and cola.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full and plush on the palate, this wine shines in spicy red and black cherry, offering both a juicy core and sculpted texture. Finishing long, it retains a freshness of acidity, fine tannin and seamless oak. A dark, earthy expression of the grape with a twist of spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With its 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a wine that is structured while marked with intense black currants. It has firm tannins and just a touch of wood. It is classic upright Bordeaux with its fine acidity and dry tannins. It will need to age, drink from 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe and richly fruity, the wine is full bodied with great acidity as well as firm tannins. It will keep for many years. Bold tannins and a fine tension between the fruit and acidity are all promising for the future. Drink this impressive wine from 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh and fruity, this has light tannins and a stalky black currant character that will produce a smooth and juicy wine as it ages. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light ruby in color, this offers fresh raspberry and red cherry aromas, slightly softer flavors of ripe plum and a smooth texture. It is medium bodied and easy to enjoy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The color is deeper and darker than average. Aromas are like superripe plums, while flavors resemble sweet plums and blackberries. It's a generous and smooth wine that's not deep in flavor, but pleasant and easy to enjoy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offers soft, ripe fruit with acidity, delicious forward tannins and cherry flavors. Bright and fruity, the wine is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of woodshop, coconut and oak extract lead the nose. The warm palate offers up prune, toasted oak and a confectionary note but no fruit richness. Mouth-puckering tannins and evident alcohol provide the framework.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of cedar, tobacco and vanilla accent dark-berry scents in front of a palate with edgy tannins and sharp acidity. Blackberry, black cherry, tobacco and vanilla are the key flavors on this good but grating Tempranillo that finishes with oaky flavors of vanilla and tobacco.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe aromas of baked berry fruits and raisin are limited but fine. A plump mouthfeel is pushed by acidic zing, yet overall the palate isn't all that exact in structure. Plum and cassis flavors finish jammy but good.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark, rubbery, generic berry aromas are a touch cheesy but full. This feels tannic and roasted, while flavors of cassis and berry come across lightly herbal and baked.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This smoky wine offers some attractive ripe fruits and stalky tannins. It is fresh, showing black currant acidity, a rounded wine that will develop quickly. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With 70% Cabernet in the blend, this structured wine still shows signs of its new-wood aging along with eucalyptus flavors. The black currant fruits are developing well alongside the wood, bringing out the concentration and acidity from the old vines. It will be ready to drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This structured wine still has a youthful fruity character, juicy with black currant flavors. The contrast is with the leaner, smoky side that comes from the tannins. It needs to age; drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A series of tannins washes over bright cherry fruits. The wine is all about berries and fresh acidity that are lightly textured. It finishes with acidity and a crisp, fruity aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This brooding wine shows notes of tire rubber, herbs, dark chocolate and blue fruit. It's elegant, with mouthwatering acids and grainy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tropical, floral aromas are modest but enchanting. Plump and balanced on the palate, this blend tastes a bit yeasty and creamy, with green banana and herbal infusions. A floral finish shows a touch of bitterness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big, ripe and fruity, this is an attractive wine for drinking soon. With its black currant fruitiness, smoky tannins and juicy acidity, it's fresh while still rich and dense.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an aromatically subdued wine with notes of peach, pineapple and spice. It's medium bodied, elegant in style with a lightly creamy feel, seeming a bit dilute.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Clean peach and melon aromas are basic but nice. The texture on this Godello is a bit oily and grabby but good, while tangerine, nectarine and peach flavors finish with some weight but also enough citric acidity to maintain freshness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Syrah, 19% Malbec and 14% Carmenère. It shows an unusual mix of cayenne, carob, pencil lead and dried herb aromas. The palate has sweet fruit flavors backed by dry, blocky tannins, falling a bit flat on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of toasted oak, espresso and a balsamic note continue to the palate, along with shriveled berry, tobacco and a hint of anisette. Displaying the heat of the vintage, the fruit is already dried up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This has aromas of leafy forest floor and wet soil. The palate isn't very expressive, offering raw red berry, coffee and a green note of dried sage alongside tightly packed tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of spirit-soaked plum, menthol and a balsamic note come together in the glass. The warm, monolithic palate pulls together dense black cherry, vanilla, coffee and licorice alongside raspy tannins and the heat of alcohol.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Reflecting the heat of the vintage, aromas recall stewed prune, fig and toasted oak. The hearty but one-dimensional palate delivers dried berry, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and anisette alongside raspy, mouth-puckering tannins. Searing alcohol dominates the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine offers notes of herbs, tire rubber and sweet plum. The fruit flavors are sweet and broad backed by grippy tannins, finishing a bit short but still bringing plenty of appeal.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas recall stewed plum, leather, eucalyptus and a hint of cellar floor. The palate is muddled between candied and bitter sensations, offering red berry, anisette, spearmint, astringent powdered sage and a confectionary note. Assertive tannins leave a drying finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of baked plum, grilled herb, espresso and scorched earth lead the nose. The palate displays the heat of the vintage, offering fig, prune, anisette and a coffee note but no fruit richness. Raspy, mouth-puckering tannins provide the framework.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Saucy aromas of molasses, baked beans, tomato and asphalt are gritty. Ditto the palate, which is snappy and hard around the edges. Flavors of leafy, spicy plum and cherry are mildly green and herbal, as is the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A salty, briny, minerally quality is pronounced in this larger-scale wine that opens intensely sour before mellowing into green apple and quince notes. Medium in weight, body and impact, it finishes with a tartness that suggests the need for food.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This stainless study shows crisp and ripe yellow apple flesh, with white rock and slate minerality. Apples, from Golden Delicious to red, also dominate the flavor profile, which is straightforward and accessible, though not complex.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Unusual notes suggest cherry, allspice and hickory smoke. It's full bodied with cherry flavors and firm tannins that lead to a mesquite-filled finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of Viognier (81%) and Roussanne, this conveys overripe pear, flowers, quinine and stone fruit. It drinks dry with a broad feel to the lightly spritzy fruit flavors that don't entirely knit together.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Warm butter and light toasted oak scents meld with smoked lemon and walnut hints on the nose of this reserve bottling. The palate is soft and almost sweet upon entry, its cashew and roasted apple flavors buttressed by a grippy tannic texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Unabashedly buttery and oaky in aroma and flavor, this first-class, full-bodied wine has a mouth-filling, creamy texture that lingers long into the finish. It starts with buttered toast and almond aromas and opens into a rich pear-and-hazelnut palate, its flavors unfolding in nuanced layers.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Slightly creamy blossom and peach hints mark the nose of this wine. The palate is gently fruited—dry and light with a lovely aromatic aura of honeysuckle, jasmin, peach and lemon. Lithe and bright, it's perfect for a summer night.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A touch of yeast and sage emerges amidst lime peel scents on the nose of this wine. The palate reinforces those flavors, while white pepper and lime notes tingle around the edges. It's lean but concnetrated and finishes with such a clean and refreshing zip that you just want to sip more.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A classic expression of Hawke's Bay Sauvignon Blanc, this is a ripe, open-knit wine tinged with barrel influence. Vanilla and tangerine mingle with hints of smoke, lingering elegantly on the long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mulberry, wet rock and sagebrush show on the nose of this single vineyard bottling from a site owned by the Hahn family. The palate is tangy at first, revealing dark red fruit with a smoky kick as it opens, backed by hints of juniper and dust.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dusty mocha scents meet cedar and herb in this dense, full-bodied wine. Spicy acidity keeps it fresh on the palate, with a zing of clove, cinnamon and black pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine leads with a touch of smoke and cinnamon. The underlying blueberry fruit is brooding and crunchy, bringing freshness to the medium-bodied palate. Aromatic waves of spice and pure, vibrant fruit carry long into the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Yellow stone fruit, crushed herb and tomato vine aromas leap from the glass. The creamy palate boasts lively elegance, offering ripe peach, juicy grapefruit, chopped mint and stony mineral flavors before finishing on a tangy note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine leads with lovely touch of flint, accentuating its green pear and lemon zest aromas. On the palate, it's light and dry, with a phenolic character that lends both texture and structure, adding complexity to all the freshness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Nutty and slightly reduced on the nose, this wine shines in tart acidity and fleshy texture. Lemon peel, pineapple and mango notes give it a wealth of fresh fruit flavor, a lilt of lemongrass providing a touch of spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Produced with consultant Hubert de Boüard of Château Angélus in Saint-Emilion, this wine is complex, impressive and packed with red and black fruits. It has a fine juicy character as well as a dry core of tannins and wood aging. It could probably do with some more aging and will be better from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An eclectic range of grapes including Tibouren and Rolle go into this harmonious wine. The Provence cru classé estate has made a rich wine, full with red fruits as well as intense acidity and a tight structure. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a beautifully structured ripe wine that is full of dense red fruits and tightly wrought acidity. Crisply textured raspberry flavors dominate. This is a rich wine that can be kept for a few months. Drink at the end of 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine comes from a single, high-elevation vineyard owned by Château Lagrézette. Wood aged, it smooths out the naturally creamy Viognier to give a broad generous wine. Spice and apricot fruits are balanced by green-fruit acidity. The opulent wine is just about ready to drink although it will be better from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This youthful ten-year-old demonstrates the impressive aging potential of well-made Greco di Tufo, opening with compelling dried stone fruit, Spanish broom, herb and smoky aromas. The round, smooth palate doles out creamy peach, mature Bartlett pear and lemon drop flavors. An energizing mineral note lingers on the finish. It's at its peak so drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Produced from vineyards around the chateau Gilles Pedini took over in 2011, this is warm and ripe wine. It balances rich red-berry fruits with acidity to give a crisp edge to a smooth wine. With intense fruitiness and a delicious aftertaste, this is a great food wine, ready to drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Located at the base of the Sainte-Victoire mountain, this vineyard, owned by the Dragon family for four generations, has produced a ripe wine, full-bodied and with concentration. It has raspberry flavors and a touch of spice that gives the wine extra richness. Drink this dense wine from late 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This rich wine comes from the sheltered vineyards close to Mount Sainte-Victoire. The weight of the ripe fruit gives a full-bodied style with both acidity and a spicy, peppery character. This is a wine to hold for a few months and drink from late 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A light and deliciously fruity wine, this is crisp and bone dry. It has great fruitiness with lively acidity and red-fruit flavors. The wine has a zest and lift to it that is irresistible. It comes from an estate owned by the proprietors of Château Talbot in Bordeaux's Saint-Julien. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lightness and ease are the virtues of this refreshing, lovely summer wine. A faintly floral honeysuckle note sets the tone for restraint. The palate delivers the varietal flavors of honey and grape through a prism of lemon zestiness. The finish is dry and long.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A glowingly ripe notion of Golden Delicious apple rises from the glass. The palate adds poise and freshness to that generous fruit, leaving a juicy yet slender sensation of friendly fruitiness. Let this grow on you; the appetizing finish reveals more red apple and supple citrus.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This deep and hearty blend of 35% Petit Verdot, 30% Merlot, 29% Petite Sirah and 6% Syrah shows ripe blueberry, loamy soil, violet and milk chocolate notes on the lavish nose. It's thick on the palate, with ever-present and evenly dispersed tannins that drive caramelized black currant, cocoa and charred coffee flavors into the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Boysenberry, black plum, condensed rose petal and cola touches show on the nose of this clonal selection, which offers very purple-seeming aromas. Ripe black cherry fruit leads the palate, followed by rounded vanilla notes, over a backdrop of thyme, bay leaf and graphite.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Honeysuckle scents provide an inviting aromatic profile in this bold and ripe blend of 76% Sauvignon Blanc and 24% Sémillon, as zippy acidity keeps it fresh in the glass. Its sublimely smooth texture delivers apricot and peach fruitiness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% varietal wine is spicy and succulent, with a touch of oak reduction on the nose that resolves as it opens. Big boned, it tastes dark cherry- and plum-driven, spiked with cinnamon and black pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A deep sunset-rose color, this has stellar cherry fruit dappled with coriander. Dry, spicy and compelling, it's one of the most powerful rosés you will encounter from Oregon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Baked raisiny aromas of spice cake are almost overdone. Like many 2009 RDDs, this is huge, tannic and massive as a whole. A woody flavor profile includes earthy jammy berry fruit, while this is heavy with campfire notes on the finish. This is 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink through 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Beautiful, ripe fruit flavors light up this full-bodied but silky-textured wine. It leaves an almost-sweet impression, as layers of blackberry, raspberry and strawberry coat the palate and linger on the finish. The texture is almost syrupy because the wine is so rich, making it a great pairing for chocolate or aged cheese.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright sparks of red currant, black cherry and cassis provide this full-bodied wine with a juicy, rounded personality. Bold tannins frame its dense layers of fruit, complemented by sultry, gamy meat and smoke accents.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with aromas that recall leafy underbrush, grilled porcini and mature dark-skinned fruit. The taut palate offers dried black cherry, coffee, sage and anise alongside tightly wound tannins that give it a firm finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Weedy underbrush, leather, mature berry and a whiff of cellar floor open. The full-bodied but somewhat evolved palate shows toast, mocha, grilled mushroom and dried black cherry alongside tightly knit tannins. Give the tannins a few years to unwind but then drink sooner rather than later to catch what fruit richness remains.\n",

      "Rounded, warmer notes of Gala apple, lemon rinds and flaky pastry show on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling from veteran Chuck Carlson. The palate is clean and complex, with apple bitters, orange rind and wet-stone elements.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas that recall sugared plum, espresso, toast and underbrush lead the way on this robust wine. The densely concentrated palate offers stewed prune, vanilla, mocha, coffee and toasted oak alongside grainy tannins that leave a teeth-coating, tongue-drying finish. It's extremely ripe and you'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The apple, pear and spice aromas and flavors display freshness. There is no apparent new oak influence, putting the focus on varietal purity. The finish lingers.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a soft, ripe wine, with juicy acidity to keep it fresh. Flavors of lemon, tangy spice and baked apples are balanced by the taut texture of this still-young wine. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Coming from a single vineyard, this rich wine has concentration as well as ripe yellow and green fruits. It's a wine to age for a few more months to bring out all its complexity. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas of lemon, soil and flowers are quite subdued. The flavors are restrained with impressive balance and the variety's often burly tannins well tamed.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (61%), Merlot (25%) and Cabernet Franc, the aromas of spice, graphite, vanilla, and dried and fresh herbs are all high toned, with the fruit seeming subdued. The flavors are pitch-black, displaying the warmth of the vintage while keeping its heat in check.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from 100% Vranec, this wine has aromas of sour cherry, black plum and black pepper. It is full bodied with flavors of tart cherry, blackberry, and leather.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blue fruit stars in this juicily exuberant wine that shows upfront citrus, red cherry and a spark of campfire-like smoke. Its bristling acidity is balanced in a core of backbone-building tannin that gives it weight and depth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Luscious black plum and cherry are swirled in vanilla, spice and cedar on the nose of this velvety, brisk Cabernet Sauvignon. It's an elegant wine with a palate that exudes restraint and elegance. A delicate fringe of tannins lingers through a long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Toast, truffle, coconut and oak aromas unfold on this robust wine. The densely concentrated palate shows dried black cherry, bitter chocolate and oak-driven spice alongside austere, teeth-coating tannins that leave an astringent finish. It doesn't have quite enough fruit richness to stand up to the oak sensations.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Barrel spice, violet, tobacco and earth aromas are followed by blue- and purple-fruit flavors, with the tannins showing a surprising amount of softness and suppleness for the variety. It's a mixture of intrigue and delivery, with a finish that glides.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blackberry jam, cherry blossom and a touch of baking spice show on the nose of this wine from a Westside Paso property. Nicely tight and bright on the palate, it is structured with fine-grained tannins.It offers blueberries, clove spice and a rocky character throughout the sip, especially into the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Kiona Vineyard on Red Mountain provides the fruit for this wine, along with Chandler Reach in the Yakima Valley. Baking spice, clove and anise aromas are followed by light, tart red fruit flavors that trail slightly toward the spice filled finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas of red currant, raspberry and cranberry are quite ripe, with cedar notes providing an accent. The palate is high octane with the fruit not quite having the intensity to match.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very young, this firm, structured wine has dense tannins and a dry core. All of this will open up to bring in the red fruits waiting behind this formidable facade. It needs to age, so drink from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose suggests truffle around compact cherry fruit. The wine is nicely balanced, relatively high in acid, and fashioned for elegance more than power. A finishing whiff of chocolate adds interest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Seductively tart in lemon pith, cranberry and pomegranate, this refreshing, light-bodied quaff is infinitely enjoyable, both on its own or at the table. It continues to expand on the palate into an increasing array of fresh flavors, finishing in cherry and orange.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here's an easygoing red that opens with aromas of rose water, wild berry and aromatic herb. Made entirely with Sangiovese, the palate offers ripe dark cherry, raspberry and savory herb, while live acidity and polished tannins provide support.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The blackberry jam, green olive, smoked meat, dried herb, gravel, flower and orange peel aromas provide plenty of interest and intrigue, though a tire rubber note distracts. The black fruit and savory flavors coat the palate with a supple feel that brings depth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% Ribolla Gialla has aromas of green apple and apple cider. There's nice minerality in the mouth with flavors of apple pie, apple cider and a touch of creaminess. The finish is pleasantly bright.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of forest floor, new leather, cherries marinated in spirits, crushed violet and menthol open on the nose. On the warm, one-dimensional palate, tightly wound tannins frame ripe black cherry and baking spice. Give the tannins a few years to unwind then drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made with 40% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Sangiovese and 5% Petit Verdot, this offers aromas of black cherry, leather and green bell pepper. The firm palate shows mature plum, vanilla and cedar alongside tightly wound tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A nose of cut herbs and just-mown grass backed by notes of white peach barely prepares the taste buds for full-on citrus flavors of lemon, grapefruit and orange peel. It is bright and zesty on the palate, and the finish offers an unexpected but pleasant jolt of eucalyptus.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A tribute to the art of blending, this wine is a mix of 10 different varieties with none making up even a third of the blend. It leads with aromas of plummy blue fruit, smoke, vanilla and herbs followed by plump fruit flavors and lightly grippy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blends Dijon clones 76 and 96, and is partially barrel fermented. The spicy nose sharpens the palate with pine needle aromas, and the flavors follow. It's a precise wine, showing pine and mineral more than fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cocoa and spice notes mix with red currant and plum. The palate is elegant in style and brings a fine sense of balance and appeal to the mouth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plum, violet and menthol aromas unfold on this medium-bodied red. The round palate offers black cherry accented with notes of ground pepper and star anise while ripe, close-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's been no price increase for this outstanding value, but the quality keeps going up and up. It's packed with juicy red berry and cassis fruit—supple, tangy, deep and lingering. The finish carries a suggestion of chalk, more in the sense of minerality than any artificial dryness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of five different varieties with Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah making up 70% of the mix, it brings intriguing notes of cranberry, raspberry jam and fruit leather. The palate is full bodied with rich dried cherry flavors and firm tannins that need time in the cellar to soften.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A bit lighter in color than many of Dave Corey's other inky bombs, this offers sweet cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg on the nose, with pipe tobacco emerging into the palate as well. It veers toward cognac, brandy and espresso liqueur once sipped. All ripeness, spice and barrel-age.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dave Corey co-fermented 83% Grenache with 17% Syrah to produce this rich wine, which offers nose-tingling aromas of blackberry brandy. It's soft once sipped, but also a bit brutal, with blood and barrel-age prominent alongside flavors of blackberry-peppercorn cake. Serve as dessert.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sonoma's Roessler brothers deliver a great Grenache, with cinnamon spice, rose petals, squeezed strawberries and pie crust on the nose. Bright acidity shines on the palate, with red berries and strawberry spritzer flavors. Good tension between tannins and bitterness leads to a mouthwatering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from a mix of vineyards across the Napa Valley, this pays tribute to the early days of grape growing in the region and is a wine equally worthy of recognition. Exhibiting dark cherry stone and wild strawberry aromas, the palate is complex, tannic and round, a subtle suggestion of smoke on the finish balanced by bright acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sharp anise, violet and menthol scents swirl around a core of rich blackberry jam on this wine, hitting the palate with serious thickness. The Kamal, named after an 8th-century navigation device, also features the other four Bordeaux varietals. It delivers flavors of deep plum jelly, cherry syrup, pepper and cedar.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Inebriating aromas of hearty tobacco, black earth, cassis and prune kick off another barrel-aged monster from Dave Corey. The cherry syrup and plum liqueur flavors remain bright with strong acidity as well as sturdy tannic structure, meaning this one will last until 2020 at least.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe and full in the mouth, this is a yellow fruit and citrus flavored wine. Tangy, salty and textured, it also has a rich feel with its peach and kiwi accents. It's a wine for aging, so drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This soft wine shows a rounded character. It's balanced, with acidity giving a supporting freshness and texture to the full, rich creaminess. Full in the mouth and dense, it could age further. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This mature Bordeaux-style blend is earthy on the nose, with tobacco, clay and loamy berry aromas. Despite its age, the palate is still showing red-fruit acidity matched against ripeness and weight. A mix of dried berry, tomato, tobacco, spice and salty flavors finish loamy and smooth. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soft and dusty, this is an herbal, elegant Cabernet from big mountain fruit, the tannins well-managed. It starts out with an intensity of black fruit followed by sturdy structure and a finish of chocolate and coffee.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich, ripe yellow cherries and honeysuckle waft from this luxuriously honeyed off-dry Riesling. A sweet tangerine flavor is densely concentrated on the palate, yet the wine is sprightly and zesty in mouthfeel. An elegant floral spray extends the long, lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sourced from a prime site embedded within the cool confines of Green Valley, this is crisp yet rich, intensely creamy and ripe in pear, lemon and caramel. It's refined and balanced in acidity, too. The finish offers a taste of crème brûlée and wet stone.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bouza ranks as one of Uruguay's top wineries, and this blend of Tannat, Merlot and Tempranillo is rich, smooth and balanced. Aromas of cassis, raisin and leather find their groove with the help of airing, while baked, ripe flavors of cassis and pastry finish well. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich, spicy and perfumed, this delicious wine is developing well and also has aging potential. It is packed with berry and plum fruits that parade with acidity and tannins that act as a support. It's still dense and the balanced fruit and tannins will allow it to age. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Powerfully tannic, this dense and firm wine is dark in both color and fruit flavors. Tannins dominate the structure, giving a solid core to a wine that will certainly age. It has richness, juicy berry fruits and plums shining with acidity. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While the wine is very dense, it also has layers of very ripe fruits, plums and dark berries that give it an intensely rich character. The juicy acidity is almost overwhelming, a shock of freshness as it cuts through the concentrated texture. The wine still needs to age, so drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This complex, spicy and fruity wine is big, with attractive acidity. It is piled with berry fruits that give a rich character. The fruits are supported by well-judged wood. This full-bodied wine will develop well; drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh-squeezed blueberry, warm saddle leather and pitch-black chewing tobacco aromas introduce an awesome Cab Franc experience from an unirrigated vineyard planted in 1985. The cedar and even tannin flavors mesh elegantly with the blue and purple fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A bold, rich wine fringed with tannins, at a young age it already shows a solid structure of ripe and juicy berry tones. With well-balanced oak aging, slightly toasty notes show restraint on this dark and complex wine that has potential to age. Drink after 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tasty and well integrated, this offers fresh fruit flavors married to subtle oak nuances. It's medium bodied and balanced in acidity, which bolsters the ripe fruit flavors, vanilla and baking spice accents.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A new wine by father-son team Tom and Rob Sinton, whose forebears partnered with Louis Martini during Prohibition. This blends in Merlot and Petit Verdot from a handful of vineyards, including Stagecoach and Konrad. It's herbal and peppery, exhibiting dark berry and coffee notes as well as soft, mellowed tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This orange-style wine is dark straw in color and has jasmine and vanilla tones on the nose, while flavors of canned apricots and fresh peaches drive the palate. There's a soft and sensuous finish, due to the 18 month barrels aging.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of pink grapefruit, grass and coriander seed open the palate of this wine. Passion fruit, apricot, green apple and freshly chopped parsley mark the palate, with a touch of iodine on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offers excellent refinement, with high-toned red-berry fruit and sarsaparilla that are on the edge of jammy—in a good way. Noticeable yet balanced acidity and generous tannins provide a solid structure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Distinctive in aroma and flavor profile, this medium-bodied red smells like cedar, tobacco and black pepper. A blend of Mourvèdre, Montepulciano and Barbera, it boasts an earthy personality that is appealing and unique. Fifteen percent of the proceeds from the sale of this wine are contributed to the Return To Freedom Wild Horse Sanctuary.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a wine with nerve, opening with notes of mineral and pine. It tastes true to its Tuscan roots, thanks to a tart red-cherry flavor. Far from being a fruit bomb, it's all about structure and complexity, with medium tannins and enervating acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a structured, fairly austere Cabernet fermented in stainless steel and then aged in French oak. Dark and concentrated, the profile ripe in blackberry, cedar, sage and bittersweet chocolate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy and reminiscent of a rainy forest floor, this coastal Syrah is smoothly textured and round with a grip on the back palate, the fruit juicy and red, high-toned all around. An approachable Syrah with complexity to spare, it fits expertly on the table, duck confit on hand.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Classic notes of lychee and rose petal waft on the nose of this delicate Gewürztraminer. Off dry in style, it's brisk and dancing, offsetting plush, juicy white grapefruit with spice and honey. Finishes briskly on a sugary pastry note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Heavily oaked and overtly toasty, this mature, barrel-aged Godello from Bierzo is round, creamy and braced by citric acidity. Resiny, oak-based spice, melon and peach flavors are consistent and lasting on the finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With cedar and tobacco aromas, and vivid black cherry and black currant flavors, this full-bodied red has lots of fruit character and complexity to match its firm tannins and bold texture. A welcome spice component from oak aging starts in the aroma and continues through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This luminous Nebbiolo from the mountain vineyards of Valtellina opens with a pretty fragrance of rose petal, red berries, baking spice and a whiff of crushed rock. The understated palate delivers ripe wild cherry, cinnamon-spice, licorice and a mineral note alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Recalling the time when Cahors was on the pilgrim route to Santiago in Spain, this wine is a solid, structured example of Malbec. Textured berry and black currant fruits are still developing alongside the dark, dry tannins. With the tannins and the final acidity, it needs to age. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A senior version of Purple, this wood-aged wine is smooth, soft and generous, with attractive mint perfumes along with toast. Big black plum fruits are generous and warm, while still solid with tannins. The wine is drinkable, although it will be better in 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This full-bodied, focused and distinctive wine has a deep, dark color, aromas of black cherry and cocoa, and flavors that are ripe and lingering. It offers power and complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light as gossamer, this nimble off-dry Riesling enlivens the palate with delicate bursts of lemon and lime accented by blossom and pear. Brisk and clean on the finish, it's best enjoyed for it's youthful refreshment.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Whiffs of saffron and crushed stone lend an earthy tone to the nose, but the palate of this semidry Riesling is all honey and tangerines. Laser-cut acidity lends precision and lift to a moderately long finish. Quaffable and invigorating.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of ripe, dark-skinned berry and crushed violet emerge from this vibrant blend of 60% Syrah, 20% Merlot and 20% Sangiovese. The  savory palate doles out black cherries and black currants accented with notes of toast and ground pepper. It's already accessible and made to be enjoyed young.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Though a tad funky at first, this wine's nose leans toward tropical but not heavily so. Aromas convey cut lemongrass, lime candy, pineapple guava skins and a lean stone character. It's also grassy on the palate, with tight lemon juice acidity and a nectarine finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh and exotic aromas of lychee and orange-blossom water tighten up on the nose, with a more mineral-driven strain of rain on cement. It's restrained and light on the mouth-watering palate, with flavors of squeezed lemons over apples, pears, wet stone and a bit of white pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This soft wine is dominated by tropical fruits as well as fresher pear and apple. It is ripe, brightened by citrus acidity that still needs to integrate. It will be attractive to drink by the end of 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This lightly colored blend of 68% Cinsault, 17% Counoise and 15% Grenache shows slightly funky on the nose, with forest floor and barnyard elements laced between sour cherries and dried morels. The vibrant palate offers florally driven, seemingly tertiary flavors such as beef stew with purple flowers, mushrooms cooked in a lavender sauce and mocha sprinkled over damp herbs\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is lushly fruity, a big bowl full of strawberries, with a milk chocolate coating. There's nothing wimpy here, but the low alcohol keeps it zippy and perfect for warm-weather quaffing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of Syrah and Grenache provides a well-made, largely neutral canvas to wash down a wide range of foods. Hints of tangerine and peach add nuance and interest to the wet stone elements that dominate, then finish dry and mouthwatering.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rounded aromas of melon and salty peaches rise to the nose on this wine from the Monterey County appellation just south of the Santa Lucia Highlands. The palate is driven by citrus, grass and a rather extreme sense of sea salt, enhanced with mouth-watering acidity and a nectarine flesh finish. It's tasty though varietally uncommon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An oxidized style of the grape, this shows dried apricot, marzipan and macadamia nuts on the nose, all cut with a lemon juice freshness. Once sipped, there are roasted nuts, dried peaches, figs and even dates on the palate, with an iodine character through the center and a lively acidity. The exotically honeyed finish is reminiscent of baklava.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sangiovese and Merlot grapes are behind this ripe red. It opens with aromas of fleshy black cherry, black currant, blue flowers and oak-driven spice that carry over to the palate together with a mocha note. Grippy tannins provide the backbone.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This was the first vintage made at the new winery facility on site. It's a pleasing, lightly ripened wine with flavors of green berry and apple, highlights of pear skin, and an overall approachable, balanced style.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoky aromas of campfire and clove are blended with high-toned black-fruit scents draped in additional toasty oak. An energetic palate brings its share of resiny, heavy oak, while dark-berry flavors come with woody, toasty, charred accents that suggest clove and black pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A self-described “irreverent blend” of Pinot Noir (70%) and Syrah (30%), Rubeo manages to capture both the finesse of the former and the power of the latter. Pinot is rarely blended in a still wine, but Lynn Penner-Ash pulls it off in in this selection, showing pretty strawberry and raspberry fruit, dusted with cinnamon, coffee and toast.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Solid but jammy black cherry and blackberry aromas come with hints of forest and rubber. This is flush and easygoing in feel, with a friendly, not demanding mouthfeel. Boysenberry and plum flavors finish round and fleshy, with mild tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a trio of vineyards in the appellation, including the producer's estate, this wine has an herbal, feral quality around layers of red berry and dark currant. With big shoulders and a velvety texture, it goes down easily and finishes light.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pollen and dusty mineral notes persist from nose to palate, but are mingled into concentrated layers of orange, honey and quince in this light-footed spätlese. Zesty and spry, it finishes brisk and clean. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright, fruity aromas and straightforward cherry and strawberry flavors make this a rather light, fresh wine. It has good balance between the almost-sweet fruit and lively acidity, so it stays appetizing on the second and third sips.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromatic and quite fruity, this offers flavors of peach, candied lemon and orange marmalade. It's fully dry, but all that fruit gives it a roundness missing from steelier Spanish versions.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very citrusy aromas of fresh squeezed lemons grow rounder with pear and nectarine flesh, all cut by a white rock minerality, without many of the typical grassy notes. The palate is very tight with lime juice and green apples, and driven by chalky grip and vibrant acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This warm-climate Pinot Noir appeals to those who prefer density on the palate. Cranberry and tart cherry dominate on the nose, followed by richer elements of strawberry tart, earth and milk chocolate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright and fruity, this Sangiovese offers aromas of wild berry, clove and tilled soil. The easy-drinking palate doles out dark cherry, raspberry, white pepper and a hint of crushed mint alongside polished tannins. Enjoy through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A good effort in a cool vintage, the winery's top cuvée brings tart cranberry and cherry fruit, racy and fresh, along with flavors of stem and herb. The wine spent 11 months in barrel, but shows no significant oak flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fragrances suggest hay, crushed tomato vine and exotic fruit. The bright but structured palate delivers peach, papaya, cantaloupe and energizing mineral notes alongside fresh acidity. It's nicely balanced with good length,\n",

      "This is one of Oregon's most unique wines, and one that rises confidently to the level of excellent cru Beaujolais in a ripe year. Bright and spicy with generous flavors of strawberry and blueberry, this sports lip-smacking acidity and a dash of minerality. The sweet young fruit is full, forward and delicious.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This elegant wine is dry, balanced in alcohol and classically proportioned. Full-bodied flavors of blackberries, currants and plums lead to a spicy finish. Rich and complex, it shows heightened structure, courtesy perhaps of its Yountville origin. Drink now–2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bone dry, tart in acidity and seemingly simple, this is the most expensive of Calera's five new Pinot Noirs. It's not showing well now, with tight, mouthwatering cranberry, rosehip tea and tobacco flavors. It feels elegant and silky in the mouth. Give until 2020 in the cellar.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aged entirely in large casks, this rich wine offers floral aromas with hints of exotic fruit and melon. The creamy palate delivers juicy Golden Delicious apple, pear and pear accented with a graphite note and baking spices alongside vibrant acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A strongly wood-aged wine, full of as much spice and toast as fruit. It will probably soften and round out to give a wine that, while firm, will have rich black currant fruitiness, dusty tannins and fresh acidity at the end. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is like a second wine of Château Lagrézette, bringing out fruit as much as structure. It's full of ripe black fruits, sweet wood flavors and final acidity. A touch of truffle points up a lightly herbal character, adding complexity while not losing sight of the rich nature of the wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is no messing with Reguengos wines. They are big, bold, ripe and juicy. Sometimes they also have a more serious intent. This wine brings out structure, a mineral texture as well as rich red fruits, and the possibility of aging. Drink after 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This balances tart red berry and cherry flavors against a backdrop of warm vanilla and spice tones. It's refreshingly crisp on the palate and finishes long, with a spray of green herbs and fine, lingering tannins. Well balanced and elegant in style.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Recognized for its good value, Saint-Romain is particularly strong on white wines. This wine, from old vines, shows some concentration and rich fruits that are balanced by toast flavors. It is a ripe wine with a strongly refreshing feel at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From grapes grown in the high altitude Castel Ringberg vineyard, Elena Walch delivers a vibrant, balanced wine that shows structure and finesse. It's loaded with sensations of Granny Smith apple, lemon zest, banana peel and an underlying mineral note that carries to the crisp finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This structured wine opens with aromas of green apple, pear, clove and a hint of nutmeg that all carry over to the palate along with a mineral note. The creamy texture has nice weight and is brightened by vibrant acidity. Oliver McCrum, T. Edward Wines.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is undeniably rich, but it wears its richness easily, allowing the fruitiness to show through. With hints of wood aging, spice as well as peach and ripe apricot fruits, it is full of potential. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This rich, wood-aged wine fully expresses the ripe fruit that comes from the Alentejo plains. It is dense with concentrated tannins and powerful black fruits. With its licorice, toast and powerful fruitiness, it needs some more aging. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A very rounded, wood-aged wine, this is rich and admittedly delicious, although the wood smothers the fruit. It has hints of ripe yellow fruits, a touch of quince and a fine line of citrus to finish it off. Give it until 2015 for the wood to balance out.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The blackberry, black currant, cassis and licorice flavors on this wine are strong, ripe and complex, and a rich coating of oak brings toast and vanilla notes. But the wine, which is a blend based on Cabernet Franc and Merlot, is so tannic that it's hard to appreciate now. Give it until 2019 to come around.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas include white spring flowers, apples and flint with light notes of toasted oak and vanilla. The juicy palate offers Golden Delicous apples and pear alongside an energizing mineral purity and bright acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This new offering is light and elegant, with tart fruit flavors of rhubarb and pomegranate. There's an herbal edge to the wine, all in proportion, with generous acidity that could reward a few more years in the bottle.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Close to Gaillac, this vineyard has a Mediterranean feel to it, making it good for Syrah. The wine is rich, softly textured, aromatic and smooth. Wood aging gives a rich texture that partners the full black fruits. It will age relatively quickly, so drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big, ripe and fruity, this wine balances its rich fruits with firm tannins. A dry core gives shape to the blackberry fruit flavors, offering aging potential. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The top wine from this château is a solid, textured effort. It has a full-bodied feel with very ripe black fruits. With its tarry texture, firm structure and generous fruits, it merits medium-term aging, although it could be drunk now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The winery's Chards always show the attractive opulence of their warm origin. While this wine is from the difficult 2011 vintage, the wine still manages to wrest plenty of tropical fruit and peach fruit flavors. Oak provides the buttered toast and vanilla, while the acidity is mouthwatering. Drink up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The tannins are strong and the blackberry, currant and oak flavors have an earthy, herbaceous tug. Instead of flamboyance, it shows precision and control, but those tannins make it too astringent to enjoy now. It will age easily until 2020; 2024 is not a stretch. Another ten years is, but you never know with a wine this dry and balanced.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is starting to show its age, disclosing hints of truffles and earth in addition to savory raspberries and cherries. The texture is silky, with an edge of acidity for balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This savory blend of 50% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Petit Verdot has aromas of red currants, toast, cedar and baking spices. The juicy palate delivers ripe red cherries, clove and white pepper alongside firm but elegant tannins. Hold another year or two to fully develop. Drink 2015–2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a ripe and fruity wine, full of red cherries, soft tannins and juicy acidity. It fills the glass with fresh flavors, ripe fruits all ready to drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Still young, it needs until late 2014 to bring out the ripe red berry fruit that will sustain the structure. The wine has weight, a juicy character and a real fruitiness at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intense aromas recall tropical fruit, crushed tomato vine and Granny Smith apples. The bright, juicy palate offers white peach, apricot, papaya, cantaloupe and almond, along with crisp acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A touch of wood aging brings spice and vanilla to this ripe, citrus and pineapple flavored wine. Very fruity, and with sophistication from the toast flavors, it finishes with almonds and the freshest acidity. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Open and fruity, this is a fresh citrus and green fruit flavored wine. It is light and crisp with only a hint of texture, more in the way of enjoyable fruitiness. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe red cherry and raspberry penetrate deeply throughout this sunny, yet briskly composed Pinot Noir. It's approachable and uncomplicated in style, but pristine juicy flavors make it quite quaffable. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raspberry flavors are front and center in this young, light wine. It keeps the tart acids in proportion, and the palate is focused and well defined. The finish turns hard and tannic, but further bottle age should soften it up a bit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Scorched soil, leather, overripe berry and espresso aromas lead the nose. The palate is still primary, offering raw sour cherry, grilled herb, tobacco and licorice alongside tightly packed tannins and nervous acidity. Drink after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Proudly boasting that there were no added sulphites in the winemaking process, this is a structured wine, firm with tannins that are backed with some juicy berry fruits. It is made to be drunk young although, in fact, it will be better with another six months of bottle aging, so wait until mid- 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A silky texture without much tannin, and vivid fruit flavors combine for a smooth and satisfying wine. It smells like fresh berries and cherries, and tastes on the light side as the fruit nuances mingle. Medium bodied, this is a pleasure to drink now. This blend was made from 49% Zinfandel, 20% Charbono, 20% Carignane and 11% Petite Sirah.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh apples and pears seem dusted in a fine mineral powder in this brisk, semisweet Riesling. It's featherlight in texture, darting and dancing alongside a lemon-lime vein of acidity that pierces through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cutting and crisp, this wine is a showcase for the complexities that exist beneath its austere mineral style. On the palate, fresh apple and pear notes are glazed by a crush of wet mineral stones. It's a refreshingly, mouth quenching wine that finishes taut and pristine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With plenty of solid tannins to keep the structure firm, this is also based around fresh black fruits. The two elements have produced a wine that, as it matures, will become balanced and poised. It's not dense, but presents elegant structure that has enough richness. Drink this wine from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Apricot aromas are singular and firmly in control of the bouquet of this Galician blend of 70% Albariño, 15% Loureira and 15% Caiño Blanco. This is juicy and fresh, but low on cushion and leesy framework. Apple and pineapple flavors run quick and finish with minerality and zest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mature berry, toast, espresso, fennel and a balsamic note lead the nose. The firm palate doles out Morello cherry, raspberry jam, powdered sage and white pepper framed in assertive, fine-grained tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas that recall red berry, chopped herb, baked earth and a whiff of leather lead the way on this polished wine. The linear palate delivers dried cherry, raspberry wild mint and a touch of white pepper that carry through to the firm finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sandalwood, hibiscus and grapeseed aromas converge on the nose of this wine that comes from a vineyard just west of the Sta. Rita Hills. The palate shows barely ripe raspberry fruit, a touch of grassiness and a spicing of anise seed, proving quite light and vibrant even at four years old.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Delicate aromas of crisp green apples, pear and white peach abound on this lean but concentrated Pinot Gris. Dry and spry, the palate is honed on minerality and refreshment. Enjoy now for its vitality and youth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Impressively dry, medium bodied, very firmly tannic and showing complex fruit flavors, this Zinfandel-based wine needs time to mellow. It smells like fresh raspberries and blackberries, and tastes concentrated and mouthcoating, while the astringent tannins hold everything back just a bit. It contains 34% Syrah and 21% Petite Sirah, and will be best after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Varietal in its celebration of lychees and roses, this wine also exudes richness and oak, while remaining relatively low in alcohol. From a fantastic site in the heart of the Russian River, it finishes in a tropical flourish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soft and round, this ripe wine offers both fruit and acidity. It is young and full of green plum and pear flavors, still textured with a young, crisp character. It needs to fill out for a few years, and will be best from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Friendly familiar aromas of lees, seashell, lemon, melon and apple set up a shearing pointed palate. Flavors of lemon-lime, green apple and gooseberry are propelled by minerally acidity, while the finish is fresh and well cut.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Malbec-led blend opens with inky, hard-packed aromas of black fruits and grilled meats. The palate is on the rough and tough side, while flavors of ripe black fruits are intertwined with strong oak and spice. Overall, this is ripe, bold and heavy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pressed berries, plum flesh, toasted cherry pits and a charred cedar scent carry the nose of this bottling by a producer in Paso's Adelaida region. It's quite easy going down, with flavors of cracked pepper, blackberry fruit and a vanilla-licorice combo toward the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "You'll find aromas of mature black cherry, dark cooking spice, mint, leather and a whiff of espresso on this full-bodied red. The firm palate shows dried black cherry, roasted coffee bean, oak and a licorice note supported by bracing, grainy tannins that leave an astringent finish. Drink after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of red berry marinated in spirits, sun baked earth, game and a hint of cured meat come together on this. The tightly wound palate offers raw red berry, grilled sage, mint, clove and anise alongside bracing tannins. Give it a few more years for the tannins to unwind, then drink sooner rather later.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromatically spicy, with a blast of citrus, this follows through with tart cranberry fruit. It's accented with pine needles and more of that tangy citrusy acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bottling is sourced from the Wit' End estate vineyard. The palate boasts broad cherry flavors, showing medium concentration and definiton. It's clean, clear and one-dimensional.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine has a nose of pineapple and roasted fennel bulb. There is a nice balance of fruit and cool herb flavors, in particular guava, lemon, roasted fennel and a touch of mint. It is slightly waxy in the mouth and cooling herbs remain on the palate until the bright finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Initially, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tannat smells murky, leathery and nutty, but with airing it settles and cleans up. Chunky and close to being oversaturated, this full-bodied red tastes of loamy berry and raisin, while the finish is weighty.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh pineapple, peach and blossom notes contrast spicy dashes of saffron, fennel and pollen throughout this Grauburgunder, or Pinot Gris.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Vibrant yellow peach, apricot and blossom notes permeate deeply through this light-footed dry Riesling. It's exuberantly primary, yet not at all cloying. Enjoy now for it's youthful vitality.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Honey, toasted almonds and lemon slushie aromas are present on the nose of this Viognier from the El Pomar district. A very smoky element on the palate is a bit overbearing alongside the caramel, vanilla and other oak-driven flavors.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Like a tropical vacation in a bottle. It smells like kiwi fruit and lime, tastes like ripe green apples, and finishes with that kiwi again. This blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Muscat and Riesling is fresh, smooth, medium bodied, ever so slightly sweet and easy to enjoy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's very little oak influence apparent in this wine that offers lean acidity and high-toned layers of citrus fruit. It could be served similarly to a Sauvignon Blanc, ready to be paired with fresh-caught oysters or clams.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "The nose on this multigrape blend is gaseous, with forceful berry aromas but little nuance. A tannic, rubbery, rock-hard palate is home to candied black-fruit flavors that are a touch green at the core. Mint and licorice flavors confirm an herbal presence on a brutally tannic finish.\n",

This is a breed unto its own. Drink now.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Quiet notes of smoked meat, flowers and toast lead on the nose of this blend of 60% Petit Verdot and 40% Syrah. Traces of mint and blackberry fill in the backdrop. This has a lush, alluring mouthfeel, but the midpalate needs a few years to gain weight.\n",

      "From Yountville, this 100% Cab is austere and lean on the nose, still closed somewhat, a waft here and there of herb and green pepper balanced by hearty black fruit and a taste of black tea. Since it's grippy on the palate, decant the wine and let it open awhile before enjoying.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Oak, sweet vanilla, chocolate and plum cake aromas take center stage. The aromas carry on to the palate but there's not enough fruit to stand up to the oak or the astringent wood-driven tannins that leave the mouth feeling dried out.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Strawberry syrup aromas laced with woody scents of cigar box kick off this wine from industry veterans John and Lane Giguiere. There is lots of vibrant acidity on the palate, carried by flavors of pomegranate and cranberry juice.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Velvety and plush, it's 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, aromatic in cedar and cassis. With a winking taste of black walnut liqueur it has a thickness to the midpalate that smoothes out on the finish, intermingling with a taste of vanilla.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With its light color, this is a soft and fruity wine that is now beginning to mature. Its red berries are acquiring a more barnyard character, while acidity is merging into the ripe texture. It's ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 50-50 blend offers a bit of dust on the nose with some eager-to-emerge blueberry. Those blueberries show up stronger on the palate, and there is a definite sense of rich, fresh-turned dirt. It's very much a soil-driven wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dried porcini and herb notes give breadth to the principal blackberry scent. It feels fluid and lithe, with a medium amount of sinewy tannins that lend the palate some traction. It's floral and peppery on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This stubbornly tight, short, tart wine shows lightly spiced cherry fruit. But after being opened for some hours, the flavors seem to thin out quickly, leaving an impression of a wine that lacks concentration.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "This ripe wine opens with a fragrance of mature red and black berry, clove and black pepper. These carry over to the warm palate alongside brooding and tightly-knit tannins. It has a forward character and soft acidity so enjoy this now and over the next few years.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 44% Petit Verdot, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Malbec, 12% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc, this is dressed with brown spices, tart cherries, dried rose petals and char aromas. Medium in body, it has polished acids and fine, muscular tannins that latch onto the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Meyer lemon pervades this wine, from the first aroma to the lingering finish. Rich and mouthfilling, there's toffee and butterscotch too. It shows the sweeter, more dessert-assortment side of Chardonnay, along with plenty of zesty apple and pear fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Quite pale, it offers fresh scents of limeade and honey on the nose, yet it is surprisingly viscous on the palate, where more honey teams with guava. A tiny bit of chalkiness stops it from being cloying. Pair with pan-fried trout or poached salmon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh and packed with red fruits, this wine comes from the Faiveley domaine. With raspberry flavors and plenty of acidity, the wine is forward and going to develop quickly. Drink from 2018.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",

      "La Casita is all clone 114 and 50% whole-cluster fermented. In a year with many wines showing minimal ripeness, this breaks the mold. The forward strawberry fruit hints at sugary sweetness. Flavors are fresh and appealing, front-loaded and best for near-term consumption.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Enticing aromas of freshly cut Cox Orange Pippin apples reach every corner of this easy, fruity wine. The palate is crisp yet full flavored, light-bodied and dry. The finish is lasting and superclean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full-fruited, expressive notes of ripe pear shine on nose and palate. This wine has lively, attractive fruit notes and bags of freshness and flavor. The palate is clean but has a soft, fresh richness at its core that makes it very moreish. Lemon notes linger beautifully.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A soft perfume of red and yellow apples appears first. These rounded but fresh flavors persist on the palate that is given poise by brisk, clean citrus freshness. The apple notes linger pleasantly on this light but satisfying wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tart and tightly wound fruit flavors range from watermelon to strawberry, with a heavy infusion of citrus. It's sharply acidic, with some suggestions of toast from light barrel aging. A streak of cola runs through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's nothing shy about this red, which is robust, earthy and forcefully tannic. It's a rough-and-tumble red with hearty black cherry, charred wood and truffled chocolate. Big flavors, and big tannins are ready for a big cut of beef.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bounteous fruit flavors need a little air to wake up but soon you'll have a party in your glass of ripe yellow plums, freshly cut apples, pears and melons. This is easy and very fruit-driven, balanced, light and just the ticket for a party in the sunshine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe notes of juicy yellow-pear waft from the glass The palate is equally full-fruited but comes with a dry, crisp and refreshing palate and a clean finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mild, controlled aromas of peach, apple and woodspice set up a cutting palate with noticeable minerality. Flavors of white pepper, apple and lime are slightly briny, while the finish feels fresh as a whistle but shy on flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Strong oaky aromas like smoke and maple syrup are backed by ripe blackberry and pomegranate flavors in this full-bodied, moderately tannic wine. The richness of texture and full, spicy flavors make a good, satisfying combination.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Peppery, grapey flavors, full body and a rich fine-grained texture make this wine distinctive to taste and soothing to drink. It's a very good example of a GSM, capturing the fullness and generosity of this type of blend made from Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre grapes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made with 50% Nero d'Avola and 50% Syrah, this presents aromas of dark berry, allspice and Mediterranean herb. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, black pepper and clove alongside fine-grained tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This winery has specialized in Cabernet Franc for 20 years, and seems to have kicked up the concentration in recent vintages. This potent wine was tight and tannic when first opened, but developed nicely over 24 hours. It has a smoky, peppery element in the aroma that segues to dark berry flavors. It will improve through at least 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of ripe orchard fruit, Mediterranean herb and toasted hazelnut lead the nose while the bright palate offers green pear, peach, unripe apricot and bitter almond. A mineral note signals the close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While a touch weightier in mouthfeel, Schloss Vollrad's standard-label bottling, this boasts the same peach and pink-grapefruit intensity that's so appealing on the Kabinett. Edged by a lacy fray of sugar, it's lip-smackingly sweet, but irresistably quaffable and neatly balanced by a streak of tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This full-bodied red opens with aromas of ripe plum, vanilla and a hint of charred topsoil. The warm, chewy palate has flavors of ripe black cherry, licorice, baking spice and coffee bean while a note of bitter almond signals the finish. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Orchard fruit, nut and acacia flower aromas meld together on this elegant white. The firm palate offers green pear, lemon zest and mineral alongside zesty acidity. A note of almond closes the tangy finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Juicy and round, this opens with scents of honeysuckle, yellow stone fruit and a hint of aromatic herb. The full-bodied palate offers ripe white peach, pear and a hint of candied lemon drop while a mineral note backs up the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bold and nicely astringent, this wine is full bodied, rich in flavor and even richer in texture due to a thick layer of fine tannins. Built almost like a Cabernet but with brighter fruit flavors, the wine is attractively dry and meant to be enjoyed with something rich like a roast or steak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of blue flower, black-skinned fruit and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub meld in the glass. The chewy, straightforward palate doles out juicy black cherry and ground pepper. It's made to drink young so enjoy soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is made from a duet of vineyards otherwise single-bottle designated: Cloud's Nest on Mount Veeder and Haystack from Atlas Peak. Smooth, rounded and rich in blackberry and raspberry, with a touch of currant, it has a woody, lasting taste of tannin.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of mango, pineapple and petrol are pure Riesling. Plump on the palate, with citrusy acidity, this tastes of green melon, lime and tarragon. On the finish, a simple, sweet melony flavor blends into a sharper grapefruit note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine, which comes from thin, granitic soils, is lean, taut and dry. Hints of lime blossom and green apple on the nose and palate give it a springtime feel, while the finish is crisp and refreshing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wild flower, toasted hazelnut, pear and aromatic herb aromas come together in the glass and follow through to the linear palate along with a dollop of honey. A light mineral note energizes the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This winery's site studies show off a nuanced side of Zin, in this case offering dried mint, sagebrush, crushed bricks and a red and purple-fruit character on the nose. Juicy olallieberry fruit emerges once sipped, but an oregano herbaceousness cuts that diligently.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of vanilla and coconut share space on the nose with ripe notes of blackberry and prune. This feels just fresh enough, with ample body. Ripe berry, raisin and chocolate flavors end a touch flat.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Heavy prune and raisin aromas are perfumed and rich, but arguably a bit overripe. Matching the nose, this feels thick, saturated and grapy. Flavors of black plum and blueberry finish chunky, with muscularity but also a rubbery flavor note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This handsome, full-bodied wine has aromas of dark cherry and toasted oak, flavors like ripe plums and vanilla and a velvety mouthfeel due to good acidity and fine-grained tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Apple, lemon oil and vinosity unite to such a degree that the nose is completely heady: here is a Riesling at the very cusp of maturity, a trajectory that has only just begun. The dry palate also reveals hints of lanolin and peach but is utterly governed by lemon freshness. This is sleek and taut, and gives you a glimpse of what mature dry Riesling can be: incisive, complex but eternally fresh. The finish is utterly clean. Drink now through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A subtle nose hints softly at lemon and crisp green apple. The palate comes in with absolutely pure streaks of lemon and stone. This is taut and uncompromising and speaks authentically of stone and citrus fruit with a promise of riper apple in the future. This needs time to come into its own and has all the concentration and juiciness it needs for cellar age. This is dry and will drink well 2020–2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The defining characteristic of Carter seems to be a taste of steel or gun metal running through the spine. It's here again, with compact fruit and drying tannins. That fruit has a dark core, and it's polished and textural, with lightly herbal highlights. This is a wine to track in the cellar over the next decade or longer.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A lovely purity of lemon oil and zest pervades both nose and palate of this straight-laced wine. There is purity and freshness, precision and tons of zesty tangy lemon. This finds its counterpoint in a lovely texture of stone and chalk. Later, ripe apple notes make an aromatic experience and stay on the dry palate all the way through the long lemony finish. Drink now through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A herbal touch of crushed lemon balm and apple peel makes for an intriguing, inviting nose. The palate adds fresh apple notes to these subtle herb notes and remains totally juicy and lively. This seems far fresher than its six years and the herbal tinges are just the beginning of maturity. This is lovely, concentrated and spirited stuff with a whistle-clean utterly dry finish. Testaments to Riesling's longevity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made entirely from Sangiovese, this opens with intense violet, red berry, Mediterranean herb and tilled soil aromas. The palate is polished and layered in crushed raspberry, juicy black cherry, pipe tobacco, mint and white pepper flavors. Velvety tannins provide structure. Enjoy through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plump strawberry and black cherry fruit provide power, but elegance is what carries this bottling, thanks to its well-integrated rose and hibiscus aromas. Cooked raspberry and ripe pomegranate notes make for a rich palate, but floral rosewater touches complete the picture. This packs punch while still being approachable in style.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This best-of-barrels bottling is intended to impress with its weight and gravitas, and it succeeds despite exhibiting more restraint than in previous vintages. Plush red strawberry and plum fruit is spiced with star anise and clove on the nose. The palate combines a sanguine element with smoky oak notes. Vanilla bean and ginger snap flavors extend toward the finish, which proves rather refreshing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a soft, complex and floral wine, sourced from an estate vineyard on Westside Road. Black cherry, tangerine and oak reduction make for a bright, brooding combination of medium-bodied lushness and subtle power.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An opaque color is a fair warning of what's to come: namely rubbery minerally black-fruit aromas that scream old vines. In the mouth, this blocky Carignan is flush and shows wall-to-wall saturation. Wild aromas of mountain herbs, blueberry and boysenberry finish sinewy and with spicy minerally black-fruit leftovers. Drink through 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a great deal of sagebrush on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard in the eastern Sta. Rita Hills, along with red cherry, pencil lead and sandalwood. Dark cherry and cranberry flavors power the palate, the fruit wrapped in hickory smoke. Thyme flavors carry into the tannic finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A rich, voluptuous nose gives way to crisp layers of lemon, pineapple and quince flavors in this barrel-kissed and full-bodied white. The ripeness of the fruit is brightened by stony minerality, allowing for a floral bite of apple blossom.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Marking the winery's 40th harvest, this vintage offers classic Sangiovese fragrance: wild berry, blue flower, baking spice and a whiff of new leather. The palate is sleek and elegant, doling out juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and star anise, framed by lithe, polished tannins and fresh acidity. It's loaded with finesse and tempting now but will be even better with a few more years in bottle. Drink 2019–2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Planted in 2006 to heirloom clones, most of them Pommard, this is a concentrated, tannic wine that needs time in bottle to develop. For now, expect rose and raspberry, with a depth of black cherry compote—flavors that are immediately inviting and richly layered. Yet, it will tell more of its story down the road. Allow it to open now or cellar through 2029.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It is the tart-ripe contrast of tangerine and ripe lemon that makes both nose and palate so enticing. The purity of flavors and this appealing contrast carry right through on the taut, bright, linear and dry palate. Its texture seems stony and profound. What stays and charms is the purity of that Amalfi lemon finish. This is so beautiful and very, very lasting. Drink 2020–2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose is most restrained: the slightest notions of jasmine and nettle appear. With more air, a faint hint of orange peel emerges. The palate is one of streamlined slenderness and precision. This is like a dry laser beam festooned with honeysuckle blossom and fresh lemon zest. There is something that draws you ever deeper into stone and citrus. The lightness of the dry palate remains simply astonishing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This hearty blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot is what put Justin on the map, and it still impresses with its elegantly woven tobacco, leather, cocoa, blueberry, and caramel aromas. It hits the palate softly, showing black cherry, baking spice, milk chocolate and faint mint notes, ending in a finish that reveals a firm tannic structure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deceptively light in color, yet aromatically rich, this sends up a lush mix of berries, spices, chocolate and pastry notes. It's youthful and vibrant, with clean, bright, tangy fruit that has the balance and power for excellent development in the bottle. Drink now through 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoked beef and pork aromas with hints of flint, licorice and black currant show on the nose of this 45% Syrah, 43% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Petit Verdot blend. The palate is soft upon entry, growing sticky with robust tannins as it opens, and offering black peppercorn, teriyaki and lavish black cherry flavors. Drink 2019–2033.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Gently perfumed hints of ripe pear almost seem to have a floral dimension. On the palate the mellow, generous and totally ripe pear fruit unfolds fully and gives glimpses of very juicy ripe, dried and baked fruit. All of this richness is countered by lemony freshness. There is an earthy textural element, and more shimmering fruit reminiscent of bottled mirabelle plums. This is generous and just off dry, with a concentrated, convincing and very moreish balanced richness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lifted aromas of both tart and ripe green and yellow apples appear, alongside hints of wet pebble and faint notions of quince. On the palate, these flavors are wrapped in citrus freshness on a sprightly, lively, concentrated and wonderfully dry palate. This is full of life and finishes on a pervasive, all-encompassing zesty lemon freshness. Lovely now but will evolve majestically. Drink now through 2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This full-bodied, well-oaked wine offers vanilla, coconut, cinnamon and red cherry aromas that meet tart cranberry, strawberry, nutmeg and cream flavors. It's expansive, well balanced, spicy and delicious and will taste best after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bottling screams white earth, with a chalk- and riverstone-like minerality and clotted cream and lemon scents. That minerality carries through to the palate, where a chalky note blends with Asian pear and marshmallow. It's a study in how to present delicate flavors with pizzazz, which the Talley family has been known to do.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cedary, spicy berry aromas are pure Rioja, but this also tosses in campfire, graphite and toast scents. A massive palate is concentrated and needs time to unfold. Flavors of plum, spice cake and pepper finish with a powerful tailwind of chocolate, herbs, spice, berry fruit and acidity. Best from 2020 through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From one of the major estates in Pessac-Léognan, this is a fine, stylish and tightly structured wine. It has spice and intense acidity to balance the dark tannins and black-currant fruit. It is going to need several years to really mature. The estate is owned by André Lurton who was influential in creating the Pessac-Léognan appellation. Drink from 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Layers of black fruits and tight tannins set this wine on a serious road. It has the freshness of the vintage as well as the bright acidity. At the same time it is structured and dense. This second wine of Château Margaux is ripe and ethereal in its lift. Drink from 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Gentle notions of pear emanate from the glass. The palate is equally gentle: ripe pear fruit, balanced by lovely lemon freshness. There is an arresting interplay of residual sweetness and zesty acidity at the core. However, the full spectrum of glorious pear fruit becomes fully expressed on the incredibly long finish. This has immense depth and will hold its poise for a few years yet. Drink now through 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An incredibly creamy notion of ripe pear rises from the glass. There are also hints of sultana. The aromatic effect is one of huge generosity. The palate, on the other hand, is taut and medium dry, corralling its richness with pleasantly bitter texture and pervading freshness. There is utter concentration, immense verve and freshness. A delicious and moreish contrast between utter precision and the abandon of generosity. The finish is long, dry and fresh.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The second wine of Ausone is powerful with plenty of firm tannins. At the same time, it is ripe, with softness from the fruit and light extraction. It is a very fine wine, delicious with its acidity and its black-currant fruitiness. Drink this wine from 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Layered botrytis that gives the wine both its richness and dense texture. It is sweet but with a dry core and crisp acidity, it will age well. It is going to be a beautiful wine, with tropical fruits, apricots and wonderful final acidity. Drink from 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This value-minded selection blends plenty of bright citrus and apple flavors with good acidity and a hint of sweetness for a complete and pleasing package. It is medium bodied, light on its feet and refreshing. Enjoy now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An extroverted, oaky and earthy wine, this has almost pungent aromas of wet soil and wood smoke, then meaty and savory flavors backed up with plum and black cherry. There is something compelling about it for adventurous drinkers.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While the nose on this dry Riesling is vivacious with lifted floral and apple aromas, the the palate is subdued with fresh, but straightforward apple and pear flavors, along with savory hints of reeds and stems. Lemony acidity is refreshing, leading to a swift finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While subdued on the nose, this offers tart red cherry and currant flavors that are refreshing and crisp on the palate. The wine is not deeply concentrated or complex, but its elegant frame and vitality are attractive.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aged in white oak barrels from Minnesota, the winemaker's home state, this wine offers exotic honeysuckle and baked pineapple at its core, beautiful aromas that gain weight on the texture. Toasted caramel and coconut define the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of Roussanne, Viognier, Marsanne and Grenache Blanc offers aromas of honey and beeswax. It's light and airy on the palate, refreshing if a tad watery with lemon juice, and a buttered-roll finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Powdery lychee and crystallized mango aromas feed into a texturally good palate with mild oily notes and good acidity. Orange, mango and lychee flavors are straight from the textbook, while lychee is the clearest lasting flavor on the finish. Drink with Indian or spicy Asian foods.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Freshness and refreshment are the strong points of this well-balanced, tangy, medium-bodied wine. It is light in fruit aroma and subtle in flavor, offering some crisp apple inspiration on the palate and finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made with Barbera (40%), Sangiovese (40%), Merlot (12%) and Syrah, this is light in color and offers notes of coffee, herbs, pencil eraser, apple and plum. It's quite light in style but shows pleasing nuances.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of Tinto Cao (30%), Tempranillo (29%), Touriga (27%) and Souzao is aromatically quiet yet unctuous in feel with rich, sweet cherry and herb flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cherry, rubber and leather aromas are tight and announce a punchy, bright, raw palate with raspberry and plum flavors. Snappy and rubbery feeling on the finish, this is a fresh Monastrell with red-fruit tendencies.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of radiator dust, lime and green apple are a bit heavy and scattershot. However the palate is tangy and lean, with cutting acidity. Lead flavors of waxy apricot are backed by orange and lime notes, while the finish is dry and waxy, with a yeasty, leesy flavor bolstered by snappy acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While the aromas of herbs and citrus seem a bit muddled, the flavors of ruby-red grapefruit, passion fruit and guava are crisp and sharply delineated on this mostly dry wine that is startlingly reminiscent of POG fruit juice—in a good way.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas recall scorched earth, underbrush, stewed prune and coconut. Oak spices, vanilla and coffee dominate the warm palate. It lacks fruit richness and can't stand up to the assertive tannins or the heat of evident alcohol.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Oaky up front, with aromas of animal, tar and medicinal red-berry fruits, this Petit Verdot is grabby and hard in feel, with a mix of oak, cough drop, berry and peppery flavors. It's big and sticky but solid on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 47% Mourvèdre, 27% Grenache and 26% Syrah conveys cherry, cranberry, pear and woodspice. The acids are tart and searing, seeming out of place.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bright, fresh and fruity wine presents an appealing mix of apricot and peach aromas, ripe and round peach flavors and a smooth texture. Rather full bodied, it is lifted by a good amount of tangy acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light and fruity, this smells like cucumbers, honeydew melon and green apple, tastes delicately appley and feels gentle in texture. It's light bodied, low in alcohol, fresh and thirst-quenching.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This full-bodied, concentrated wine is dry, quite firm and tannic in texture. It smells rich and a bit earthy, and tastes like blackberries, cranberries and beef. The style will accompany rich, meaty food very well.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This tastes and feels mellow and approachable, with gentle aromas of plums, dried herbs and tomato, and medium body with moderate tannins. It is supple and easy to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A red blend from the eastern end of the Entre deux Mers region, this is a smooth and already accessible wine. Attractive black fruits and soft tannins accompany touches of vanilla. It's ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mostly Malbec (34%) and Petit Verdot (32%), this nonvintage blend offers up-front oak notes of vanilla and dill. These are followed by cherry cola, green herbs and a whiff of volatility, along with sweet flavors and grippy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Orange blossom and acacia perfume this very pretty, spry wine. Tart green apple and pear flavors are straightforward yet refreshing on the palate, finishing briskly on a zesty lemon-lime note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made with 100% Sauvignon Blanc, this is very fresh, very crisp and herbaceous. It's all about grapefruit, lemongrass and a mineral texture. It should be aged for a few months, so drink from late 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In this full-bodied wine, the tannins are still to the fore. Its weight promises a chance to age and bring out the underlying red fruits. A smoky element from the wood aging gives complexity. Drink this attractive wine from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Initially this wine is dry and very firm, dominated by extracted tannins. Gradually the black fruits assert themselves and give a more juicy view. Probably the 14 months in wood was too long and the wine needs time to recover. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Elegantly styled, this offers notes of herbs, red cherries, barnyard, mint and cedar. Sweet fruit flavors are backed by chalky tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A serious personality comes from oaky, earthy aromas and flavors, a bit of welcome astringency and good acidity. It seems full bodied, dry and rich enough in texture to be appealing without losing the tanginess underneath.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In the south of the Entre deux Mers region, this old property has produced a fruity, wood-aged wine. It has spice, smoky tannins and attractive, balanced black currant fruits. It's likely to age over the medium-term, so drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a tribute wine, its proceeds donated to ALS research. Floral, it's also smoky, with a hit of tannin prominent on the palate on first sip. Bittersweet chocolate, game and leather finish things out.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Recalling the time when Cahors was on the pilgrim route to Santiago in Spain, this wine is a solid, structured example of Malbec. Textured berry and black currant fruits are still developing alongside the dark, dry tannins. With the tannins and the final acidity, it needs to age. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A senior version of Purple, this wood-aged wine is smooth, soft and generous, with attractive mint perfumes along with toast. Big black plum fruits are generous and warm, while still solid with tannins. The wine is drinkable, although it will be better in 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This full-bodied, focused and distinctive wine has a deep, dark color, aromas of black cherry and cocoa, and flavors that are ripe and lingering. It offers power and complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light as gossamer, this nimble off-dry Riesling enlivens the palate with delicate bursts of lemon and lime accented by blossom and pear. Brisk and clean on the finish, it's best enjoyed for it's youthful refreshment.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Heavily oaked and overtly toasty, this mature, barrel-aged Godello from Bierzo is round, creamy and braced by citric acidity. Resiny, oak-based spice, melon and peach flavors are consistent and lasting on the finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Savory apple and lemon, earth and bramble tones persist throughout this semisweet Riesling. It's refreshingly crisp and nimble making it an easy everyday pairing for casual chicken or fish dinners at home.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Whiffs of saffron and crushed stone lend an earthy tone to the nose, but the palate of this semidry Riesling is all honey and tangerines. Laser-cut acidity lends precision and lift to a moderately long finish. Quaffable and invigorating.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With cedar and tobacco aromas, and vivid black cherry and black currant flavors, this full-bodied red has lots of fruit character and complexity to match its firm tannins and bold texture. A welcome spice component from oak aging starts in the aroma and continues through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This luminous Nebbiolo from the mountain vineyards of Valtellina opens with a pretty fragrance of rose petal, red berries, baking spice and a whiff of crushed rock. The understated palate delivers ripe wild cherry, cinnamon-spice, licorice and a mineral note alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Classic notes of lychee and rose petal waft on the nose of this delicate Gewürztraminer. Off dry in style, it's brisk and dancing, offsetting plush, juicy white grapefruit with spice and honey. Finishes briskly on a sugary pastry note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Interesting aromas of mint, Christmas spice, licorice and blackberry feed into a dense, blocky palate with firm acidity. Ripe, loamy flavors of blackberry and prune finish with oak-driven graphite, mint and resiny flavors along with a note of residual cassis. This is half Garnacha and half Carignan.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mas des Bressades is one of the standard-bearers of Costières de Nîmes, and this rosé is a perennial favorite. Red berries and cherries lead the way, wrapped around a core of citrus acidity. It's light to medium in body, with a pleasantly silky feel to the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plum, berry and compost aromas are earthy and a bit herbal. Tight, drawing acidity drives the palate, while minerally plum and berry flavors are sinewy and tough, with raw tannins steering a rugged, staunch finish. Drink this gritty Carignan now through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This plump, medium-bodied rosé offers hints of peach and melon fruit, then finishes long and citrusy. It's very pale salmon in color, with an attractive coppery tint.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Initial aromas of wet cement, black cherry and cassis grow more rubbery, reduced and animal-driven the longer this Syrah sits around. Bright, fresh and fiercely tannic, this deals dark-berry flavors, peppery spice and raw oak on top of dry, herbal notes. Oaky but not overly charred or pushy on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Strongly wood and toast laden, this is a dense and tannic wine with a complex structure that dominates the blackberry fruits. It is firm and, although it can be drunk now for its rich structure, will be better from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A rainy cement minerality on the nose of this sweet wine manages to cut through the sugared oranges, honeysuckle and ripe, tropical white fleshed fruit, from peach to cherimoya. The palate is full of honeyed apples, white peach and pineapple, but the decent acidity and chalky element stops it short of treacly.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "As tasty as a pear tart, this combines mild pear, vanilla and almond flavors on a smooth texture. Medium bodied, balanced slightly to the soft side, and quite fruity, it will make a satisfying glass at cocktail time or with dinner.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Roasted apples, toasted peanuts and just a touch of buttercream combine for an inviting nose on this wine from the Terravant facility in Buellton. Oak is quite noticeable on the palate, where flavors of buttered toast, white peach jam, orange marmalade and marzipan shine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Gros Manseng takes the lead in this ripe and full wine with a fragrant floral character as well as great fruitiness. It's fresh while also having a creamy, smooth character. It is ready to drink, but will be better from the end of 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an apple-fresh sparkling wine with a lively mousse. It crisp, refreshing and clean, with attractive fruitiness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of concentrated raisins and hot brandy emerge from this dessert sipper that would do well with a cigar or fudge. The raisin elements consume the palate as well, with some acidity arising with force in the midpalate along with flavors of dried orange peels and lemon peels.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intensely concentrated, this wine offers minerally petrol and hazelnut, particularly on the nose. A salinity marks it on the medium-bodied palate, giving it an intriguing edge before finishing in a squeeze of lemon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In the Alentejo, Syrah exhibits power, body and concentration without much subtlety. So this wine is solid, tannic with considerable pepper and spice flavors that dominate the black fruits. Wood aging has softened the tannins. Acidity gives the wine a fresher finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Despite its youth this is quickly peaking in flavor. It's light but interesting, with rosewater, red apple and strawberry flavors. Tannins are soft and there's a suggestion of saddle leather. It offers plenty of enjoyment for a Pinot at this price.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fruit flavors of blue plum and blueberry are matched to a light layer of chocolate from aging in 30% new French oak. It's smooth and polished, but feels a bit stripped as it fades out, leaving some orange-flavored acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The two signature white grapes of Côtes de Gascogne give a wine flavored with tropical fruit and honey. It is delicate, ripe and just off dry. The wine is ready to drink although it will be better at the end of 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mild, clean aromas of dusty apple, lees and peach set up a creamy, full palate with low acidity and moderate definition. Papaya and melon are the lead flavors, while the finish is melony and oily, with low acidity and not much, if any, minerality.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a barrel-selection reserve, with unusual scents of pine needles and baking spices co-mingled. Deep cassis and dark chocolate flavors prevail, and the tannins have not yet softened and smoothed. Give this a few more years of bottle age.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This has a dark red-black color, with densely packed aromas that seem so tight they are not giving up much. Flavors of concentrated dark plum and white pepper are interlaced with very firm tannins. It's full bodied, young and wound up tight. Drink it now for the wow factor, or be adventurous and save it until 2020 to see how much more flavor complexity develops.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% varietal wine is velvety and dense in all the right ways, striking a balance between fruit-forwardness and savory coomplexity. Blackberry, blueberry and coffee flavors lead the palate, highlighted in supple tannin.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blackberry, cherry and plum notes form this estate wine's fruity core, complemented by an earthy thread of cedar, pencil and tobacco. Dry, firm tannins give it a structure that takes time to unwind, the finish marked by powerful grace and spicy clove.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The style of all the Craggy Range reds has evolved in recent vintages to reflect greater elegance and length. This is a medium-bodied red, supple and immediately approachable, filled with cherries, plums and vanilla and graced with a subtle floral note. Drink now–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is sourced from a longstanding, well-respected vineyard, and it does the windswept, foggy site justice. Tightly woven and youthful, it shows broad, juicy black cherry, wild strawberry, baking spice, compost and brawny oak flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a dense core of floral fragrance as well as cola and black olive touches on the nose of this tightly wound wine, which needs ample time to open. Bright and pure purple fruit meets lilac flavors on the palate, its density buoyed by balanced acidity. Over time, touches of herb and spice emerge.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from 64% Pinot Noir and 36% Syrah, this copper-tinged refresher is nutty and tangy with acidity. It offers deep grapefruit, mandarin orange and lime flavors that persist, please and quench on the palate, all in a compelling, complex light-bodied package.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the latest wine from the same producer as the popular Whispering Angel rosé. It has a wonderful herbal character that lifts the bright red-currant fruit. Acidity and fruit are allied with the mineral texture to create a wine that will be just right for food.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blending the three red grapes of Gaillac (Duras, Braucol and Syrah), this is an impressively rich wine, with signs of its wood aging just integrating with the ripe black-currant fruit and firm tannins. It has an exhilarating aftertaste of acidity and young fruits. Drink from 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a beautiful estate close to the sea, this wine has a lightly salty character. That contrasts with the zinging energy and ripeness of the fruit and balanced acidity. Citrus zest and spice complete this harmonious wine. Drink from the end of 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bottled in the Fabre family's specially designed Gallé bottle, this wine is a classic. It has fine ripe, but crisp, fruit and delicious balanced acidity. With its fresh character, which is contrasted with the intense fruit, this is a real food friendly rosé.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "On the nose, this bottling from one of the family's estate vineyards seems dark with boysenberry and purple flower touches and tangy with hints of plum skin and red currant. The palate is deceptively full bodied but also surprisingly tangy, delivering sour cranberry and eucalyptus flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Two-thirds of this wine is Malbec and one-third is Merlot. Aromas of asphalt, plum and orange rind lead to a palate that possesses a lovely sense of balance and length.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Slightly reduced and showing plenty of barrel imprint, this vineyard designate is bold and grippy, its soft entry marked by clove spice and cigar. The fruit is a combination of plum and dark cherry, subtly wrapped in vanilla toast.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full-fruited plum notes tinged with cinnamon lend a touch of warmth and generosity to the nose of this wine. The palate holds these them tight in a fresh, citrusy embrace. It's medium bodied and harmoniously balanced, with a moreish tension, fine tannins and long-lasting freshness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Red and black cherry aromas mark the nose of this wine. The palate is similarly primary and vibrant, with supple ripe berry and cherry notes. On the finish, the freshness and taut structure become apparent. This is irresistibly juicy right now but will evolve. Drink now–2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cinnamon and pepper add interest to the ripe blueberry fruit on the nose of this wine. The palate has the same generous, spicy flavors, with enough freshness to provide tension. The tannins are ripe but firm, framing all the juicy, dark and brooding fruit with perfect counterpoint. This is refreshing and intriguing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A staple of California winemaking, this vintage is as good as ever—perfectly polished, with light aromas of toasted oak and crisp green apple, lemon-lime and tempting butter flavors, and a medium-bodied frame. The texture is silky smooth, and everything tastes harmonious and balanced.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This exceptional release is firm and focused, with lip-smacking acidity. Tart apple and tangy limeade pack the core flavors, underscored with wet-stone minerality.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This smooth and sophisticated wine from the property formerly known as Breggo has good structure, no rough edges and a solid core of ripe plum and black cherry flavors, seasoned lightly with spicy oak. The texture is moderately tannic, but velvety and polished.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the head-trained, dry-farmed Martinelli Vineyard, this wine is like a lens into history. It's mighty flavorful, too, with jubilant cinnamon, rose water and wisteria aromas and a rounded and juicy palate of plum and boysenberry fruit. Asssertive baking spice notes and chalky tannins complete the picture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Enticing wildflower, chopped herb and ripe orchard fruit scents abound in this radiant wine. The palate doles out white peach, yellow pear and nectarine notes, with stony mineral accents. Fresh acidity brightens the creamy flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The understated but alluring perfume of ripe pear peel leads the nose of this wine. Its concentrated body has the lovely, peppery, yeasty midpalate feel that we always hope for in Grüner. Subtle, light, savory and fresh, it finishes dry and zesty.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A hint of passion fruit mingles with yeasty tones in this wine's aroma. The palate doles out savory, sage-like notes in a concentrated, textural frame. It finishes with a lemony, lip-smacking and refreshing fillip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich and mouth-filling, this full-bodied wine has plenty of fruit flavor and is structured with fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. It blends ripe berry and plum notes with more vibrant red cherry for complexity and has a lingering, layered finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plump Meyer lemon aromas meet rounded coconut, pineapple cream and honeysuckle on the nose of this bottling from the pioneering Franscioni family.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Approachable and jubilant rose petal, root beer, charred meat and ripe cherry aromas show on the dynamic nose of this bottling. The flavors are tighter and more focused, recalling red cherry, rust, tobacco and lava rock minerality. Tannins coat the palate with a delicate grip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fleshy red cherry notes dominate this wine's nose and palate. An edge of smoke adds aroamtic complexity to the fluid and fresh flavors. It's juicy and generous with a welcome counterpoint of supple tannins that lend structure to all the cherry fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The savoriness of yeast still lingers on the nose of this wine. The palate brings herbal and sage-like notes to the fore, highlighting its concentrated, rich flavor. Citrus overtones herald the finish, while the saltiness demands you take another sip.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A tender, floral aroma hovers over the glass in this typical Viennese field blend. The fresh, brightly toned palate sings with a host of flavors: crisp green apple, fragrant grape, zesty citrus and juicy yellow pear. A phenolic, spicy edge gives it depth and appeal. A real glassful of Vienna that's dry and delicious.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of roasted coffee bean, ripe plum and dark kitchen spice waft out of the glass. The forward palate offers mature wild cherry, licorice, sage and espresso that carry through to the firm finish. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright and fruity, this wine has a warm, ripe streak that gives it richness. It also has all the freshness and crispness of the vintage while showing a more creamy character that's typical of Saint-Aubin. It is developing quickly and could well be ready to drink in 2016, certainly by 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Warm and hearty, this opens with aromas that recall mature dark-skinned fruit, leather, truffle, scorched soil and a menthol note.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Creamy wood aromas are prominent in this ripe, yellow-fruit-flavored wine. A rich, textured character hints at minerality while bringing out fresh fruit and acidity. It is ready to drink, although some of the bursting acidity will calm down by late 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This single-vineyard Chablis is produced from organically grown grapes. It is intensely fruity, crisp with refreshing apple and lime flavors. The acidity is still bursting out of the glass and needs to calm down to bring out the steely texture. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine features tempting clove, black cherry and pomegranate flavors. It has great balance, an easygoing texture and a clean, fruity finish. It's medium to full bodied, but the oaky flavors and tannins stay well within bounds.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of hickory, herbs and leather work to accent berry scents on what is a woodsy yet elegant bouquet. Saturated, chewy and tannic, this Rioja tastes of oak, clove and plum fruit, while the finish loses its fruit fast and ends largely with barrel-related notes of resin and toast.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine smells smoky, minty and almost meaty. It tastes rich and complex, brightened and spiced by lavish use of new oak, yet built on enough ripe blackberry flavors to achieve a robust balance. It's well made in a deliberately oaky style.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A heavily charred opening emphasizes surface-level oak and baking spices more than fruit. A heavy, jabbing, grabby palate tastes herbal, with stewed berry and prune flavors. A burnt-oak flavor and severe tannins are found on the finish of this muscled-up Tempranillo. Drink through 2020.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From White Hawk Vineyard near Los Alamos, this wine has a nose that is both edgy with tangerine rind and ripe with warmer crème brûlée notes.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lifted and floral up front, this Mencía smells like light, schist-infused plum and raspberry. There's mild grab to the palate, which offers flavors of buttery oak, rubber, strawberry and rose hip. A dry, slightly briny tasting finish fades away elegantly.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of blueberry jam, scorched earth, leather, truffle and coffee lead the way on this ripe, accessible wine. The chewy palate offers fleshy blackberry, anise, toast, espresso and a confectionary note alongside mature but rather fleeting tannins. Drink 2016–2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A straightforward, modern dry Riesling, this wine shows a slight hint of gasoline, citrus blossoms, wet river stones and apple skin on the nose. The mouthfeel is more full than Mike Callahan's other bottlings, with waxy citrus skins, lime pith, sour apple, alkaline elements and a touch of white jasmine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark cherry red in color, this blend of Cinsault, Grenache Noir, Syrah and Tempranillo features a bouquet of cherry with a hint of green pepper. Flavors of raspberry, pomegranate, orange peel and spearmint are set in a web of soft tannins that fully announce themselves at the mouth-coating, minty finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cherry and plum, chocolate and peppery herbs combine here in a well-structured wine with some years of life ahead. Aged in one-third new French oak for 11 months, it will reward decanting or aeration if you are drinking it in the next year or two.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cabernet Sauvignon (68%) takes the lead, with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Malbec rounding it out. High-toned aromas of graphite, herbs, black cherry, espresso and barrel spices lead to tart flavors that are lighter in style, with the tannins providing some grip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from 89% of the indigenous grape Karasakiz and 11% Merlot, this wine presents scents of strawberry and orange blossom. It comes on bright with flavors of cherry and clementine, but as smooth tannins coat the mouth, notes of anise, violet and smoke join the chorus. The finish is also bright, with lingering flavors of smoke and flowers.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from a majority of Cabernet Franc, this wine is blended with 11% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Syrah. The fruit comes from the winery's estate vineyard in Rutherford as well as from Stagecoach Vineyard in Atlas Peak. Initially smoky, it reveals pockets of cedar and herb before unleashing juicy black cherry, chocolate and dusty, big tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is a rich blend of Aragonez, Touriga Nacional, Trincadeira and Syrah in this full, ripe, black-fruit tinged wine. It is already open and generous, with wood spice tones and a smooth texture. Drink now through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The second Syrah in the Collaboration Series, this was aged in 30% new puncheons, and opens with a potent, roasted nose. Espresso and cacao flavors dominate the tart, acidic berry fruit, with a lick of lemon verbena running through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Refermented in the bottle, this frothy, delicious red delivers rose, blue flower, juicy raspberry, sour cherry and yeasty aromas that carry over to the dry, refreshing palate. It's elegant with wonderful intensity and a juicy, lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Though designated simply as Washington state, this five grape, Cab-dominated, Bordeaux-style blend is sourced entirely from Kiona's Red Mountain vineyards. Aromatic—almost pungent—it's built around soft, ripe red fruits, augmented with a touch of leather and toast. Round, full, and ready to drink, it spent a year in 60% new oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lemberger was planted here in the 1970s, and Kiona still carries the torch for the grape. Earthy, gamy, soft and smooth, it has a quickly maturing flavor set, built upon chocolate and cherries, with dusty tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In this vintage, the winery stays true to its reputation for making balanced, more restrained Cabernet, offering firm, structured tannins and bright cassis and blackberry around a deft sprinkling of dried herb. Built to age through 2025, it is equally enjoyable now, after a decant. Small percentages of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec factor in.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of Cabernet, Syrah and Merlot, it's sappy and loaded with tart red fruits. An explosion of strawberries and raspberries washes across the tongue, resolving in pretty cherry flavors buoyed by natural acidity. Forward and full bodied, it's has enough structure to age gracefully over the next five years.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Syrah was aged in 100% new oak, two thirds American and one third French. Barrel flavors abound, especially vanilla, and the fruit seems a bit overshadowed at this point in time. The tannins are aggressive, and overall this young wine seems to need more time in bottle to smooth out.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine was made by Bordeaux-trained winemaker Denis Malbec and his wife, sommelier May-Britt Malbec. They've sourced some exceptional fruit from the Reichel Vineyard, including some Malbec, with some Cabernet Franc also blended in. Offering big tannins that await the cellar, it is otherwise a juicy wine rich in black and blue berry fruit, as well as a taste of graham cracker and cigar. Enjoy through 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blackberry, blueberry, rubber and violet aromas show a pinch of cool-vintage green. The palate on this Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère-Petit Verdot-Syrah blend is tightly wound, with grating tannins. The berry flavors are a touch leafy, while the finish brings red fruit flavors and a touch of carob. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lush in brambly blackberry, this classic Zinfandel comes from a cooler area than usual, the Russian River Valley, which manages to retain small plantings of the variety amid the larger seas of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. Spicy, the wine is balanced and fairly elegant, medium in body and weight while still packing a punch.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a new, value label under the Barons umbrella, produced by consulting winemaker Matthew Loso. Lovely raspberry fruit anchors the flavors, which are sleek and stylish and, show the craftsmanship of much more expensive vino. Dark notes of mineral and a whiff of graphite and iodine add complexity through a surprisingly long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cassis spritzer and pine tree-like herbals provide a promising start on the nose. It's rich in the mouth, with cherry, blackberry and a nice edge of black pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a rich and smooth wine, full of impressively ripe fruit tones without going over the top. Bright acidity brings balance and elegance, with juicy berry flavors rounding out the palate. Drink now through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A southern Rhone-style blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, only 20% was aged in oak. Bright, aromatic, and fleshy on the palate, and showing an array of cucumber, green leaf, lemon oil, pineapple and citrus notes, this impressive white blend hits just the right notes for lighter dishes with an herbal dressing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A lush bouquet of cooked strawberries, black cherry sauce and just a touch of allspice kick off this fun, drink-me-now wine from Santa Ynez Valley pioneer Fred Brander. Good acidity and smooth tannins reminiscent of plum skin surround a fruity palate, which boasts a flavorful arc.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Among the first vintages from a small, family-run vineyard and winery within the Chalk Hill AVA, this also contains small amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec, all estate-grown. The wine is soft and medium-bodied, brooding in savory leather and herb.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very spicy, yes, but also subtle, marrying exotic bergamot flavors with a structured, mineral texture. It is rich, cut with pepper as well as nutmeg, allowing room for some fresher acidity at the end. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is rich, broad and very spicy. At the same time, it is structured giving space for acidity and a textured character. It's ripe with a touch of pepper as well as other spices. The wine is ready to drink but will be better from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plummy and high-toned in red currant and cranberry, this single-vineyard Cabernet is a stunner. It's balanced and elegant, soft in tannins and well structured. A wine that will improve with age, it also gets better in the glass after opening.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The fruit from 40-year-old vines is reticent about showing its character at this young stage. However, in two to three years, the rich and concentrated citrus flavors and steely structure will take over and reveal a dense wine that is aromatic as well as serious. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend is garnet colored with a hint of eucalyptus in the bouquet, opening up to aromas of black fruit, forest floor and freshly picked mushroom. Minerality abounds on the palate, with flavors of red berries and black plums.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of black cherry, licorice, leather, violet and a whiff of tobacco open this wine. The palate is still a bit closed but delivers black raspberry, wild cherry, anisette and a note of black pepper alongside big, brooding tannins that need time to come around. Drink 2017–2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This elegant expression of Nebbiolo opens with aromas of dried rose, crushed violet, tilled earth, savory herb and a balsamic note. The palate offers juicy black raspberry, dark cherry, truffle, vanilla and a hint of mocha. It's balanced, with fresh acidity and supple tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Initially a bit closed, this opens with aromas of leather, leafy underbrush, tilled soil, wild berry and a whiff of cellar floor. The palate is still primary, displaying red cherry, sage and menthol alongside tightly knit tannins. Drink after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Celebrating the foundation of Cheval Quancard in 1844, this is a solid, dense and well-made wine from ripe grapes. The balance is good with tannins already integrating well into the juicy, ripe acidity. It's ready to drink but will age at least until 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Don't let the generic California appellation fool you, this is a distinctive Chardonnay. It has subtle flavors of pear and toasted oak, and shows a sophisticated and restrained style, with a vibrant fruit core and good balance. Though medium bodied, it plays crisp acidity off a lush texture and lingers on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A big, soulful wine, this has slightly funky, earthy aromas that include tilled soil, truffle, leather, underbrush and mature black fruit. The fleshy palate delivers ripe black cherry, juicy raspberry, white pepper, cinnamon, vanilla and a touch of mocha. It's structured, with tightly woven tannins that need time to soften. Drink after 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy, alluring fragrances suggest bright berry, rose petal and tilled soil. The palate delivers ripe, wild cherry completed by notes of vanilla, white and black pepper alongside youthful, bracing tannins. Drink 2016–2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A mix of bright red cherry, blueberry, thyme, and rosemary bring nuance to the nose. It's full bodied on the palate, with flavors of black cherry and black plum. A touch of salty minerality brings flair to the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cute packaging belies the surprising depth to this Riesling. It's remarkably balanced, with an array of mineral, floral and fruit dimensions. Juicy, with preserved peach flavors and zippy lemon acidity, it's a thirst-quenching, solid pick from the Pfalz.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Despite the plural on the “vineyards” designation, the source of this Chardonnay is one vineyard. It's dry, crisp and minerally, with tantalizing lemon, lime, mango and apricot flavors, finished with a French oak toastiness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a minerally, earthy tone from nose to finish on this medium-sweet Riesling, balanced by a palate that's lush in ripe stone fruit and mango flavors. Sharp, laser-focus acidity kicks in on the midpalate, finishing long, with hints of warm spice and honey.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hints of crushed mineral and struck steel lend a honed, linear feel to this dry, medium-bodied Riesling. It's a bit austere in style, but elegantly composed, with intense apple and pear flavors as well as a streak of lemon-lime on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blue flower, blackberry, leather, underbrush and vanilla aromas jump out the glass with this warm, full-bodied wine. The dense, one-dimensional palate offers ripe black cherry and sweet oak accented with vanilla and cinnamon notes. It's already reached its ideal drinking window so enjoy soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah, it conveys aromas of red and black currants, black pepper and cedar. The straightforward palate delivers juicy blackberry accented with notes of white pepper, mocha and graphite alongside round tannins. It's ready so enjoy soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Although this wine is rich and laden with wood-aging flavors, it certainly does not need such a heavy bottle. Spice, tobacco, new wood and red fruits are well combined in a wine that ripe and ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here's a refined Pinot Bianco with delicate aromas of Alpine wild flowers and white fruit. The palate delivers yellow and green apple alongside a steely mineral undertone and vibrant acidity. It closes fresh and clean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It opens with a floral fragrance of Spanish broom, jasmine and chamomile. The juicy palate delivers citrus, pineapple and almond alongside crisp acidity that lends a clean, refreshing close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A forward, softly fruity wine closer to California Pinot than most Oregon examples. The vintage contributes lush fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry, while aging in 20% new French oak brings a layer of smooth milk chocolate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It has the light, silky texture of Pinot Noir, with powerful cherry jam and red currant flavors, enhanced with smoky oak. A barbecued steak will be the perfect partner, but so will a hamburger, the rarer the better.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This structured white opens with aromas of lightly toasted oak, citrus, golden apple, and herbs. The palate delivers grapefruit, Bartlett pear, nectarines and mineral alongside fresh acidity. It closes on an almond note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here's a classic Sauvignon with intense varietal aromas of tomato vine, freshly cut grass and green melon. The linear palate delivers juicy cantaloupe and flint balanced by crisp acidity. It finishes on a note of roasted almond.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dominated by Merlot at 90%, this is a smooth, rich and generous wine. It does have a tannic core, but that is surrounded by these velvet, ripe berry fruits and opulent texture. The wine is developing well and should be drunk from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a perfumed, aromatic wine with great acidity and fresh black fruits. The wine is already softening with a good fruity character, fresh and bright at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With zippy acidity and a dry finish, this is a Pinot you might want to cellar until 2020. It's rich in oak-inspired raspberry, cherry, cola and pomegranate fruit flavors. The low alcohol gives it a light, silky texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While the savory nose leads with subdued notes of apple and lemon, this off-dry Riesling shines on the palate, with juicy stone fruit and yellow cherry flavors. Tangerine acidity adds zip and verve, leading into a finish that's fresh with herbal and floral tones.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A lovely bubbly, with Chardonnay flavors of limes, peaches and oranges. Muscat Canelli adds to the orange theme. The finish is more honeyed than most California bubblies, but crisp acidity makes it balanced. What a great wine with coconut shrimp.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It shows the classic aromas of Alto Adige Sauvignon including crushed tomato vine, just-mowed grass and exotic fruit. The crisp, juicy palate offers cantaloupe, green melon, yellow peach, a hint of spice and mineral, with fresh acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "One of the most familiar brands of Champagne, this is a soft, finely blended wine. With its fresh fruits, touch of toast and a crisp aftertaste, it is dominated by Chardonnay, in the Taittinger style. A steely edge creeps in at the end, leaving a wine that is bright and ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Subtle and crisp in minerality, this Pinot Blanc has a rich texture and a taste of apple and pear with a savory, herbal element throughout. It would serve nicely as an alternative to Chardonnay, especially on the dinner table.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This structured wine has subtle aromas of apples, vanilla and toasted notes. These carry over to the linear palate together with pear, mineral, lemon zest and lively acidity. Pair it with baked pasta dishes or grilled chicken.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from the native Turbiana grape, this attractive wine opens with aromas of beeswax, white spring flowers, green apples and a hint of honey. The fresh, juicy palate offers ripe pear, white peach and citrus alongside fresh acidity that gives a clean finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of green, fresh herbs and lime lend a brassy, vivacious tone that balance out this otherwise ripe, intensely fruity Riesling. It's semisweet in style, with luscious peach and apple flavors.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A darker, quite savory expression of Black Kite's entire vineyard site in the Deep End of Anderson Valley, this Pinot imparts a touch of cardamom spice and high acidity, with a dryness to the finish that gets a lift from that acid at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very elegant, it opens with refined aromas of rose petals, lychee and a hint of juicy citrus fruit. The full-bodied palate delivers ripe pink grapefruit and steely mineral notes accented with a spicy note of white pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raspberry jam, orange peel and sweet oak flavors mark this Pinot Noir. It's very dry, acidic and tannic, not showing much of interest now, but the complexity suggests limited ageability. Try after 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Structured but elegant, it discloses delicate aromas of Spanish broom and Granny Smith apple. The savory, creamy palate delivers juicy Bartlett pear, citrus, nectarine and melon brightened by crisp acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Invigorating white grapefruit and lemons are cast against a deep mineral backdrop in this dry, thirst quenching wine. It's delicate and filigreed on the palate with a brisk, tight finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A bouquet of raspberry, Mediterranean herbs and black pepper pave the way for flavors of blackberry, dark plum, anise and tarragon. Lasting tannins impart a light sense of chalkiness on the tongue that dissipates in a burst of fruit on the bright cherry finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offers a classic Nebbiolo nose of rose petal, dark berry, tilled earth and a balsamic note. The lean palate shows sour red berry, grilled herb, clove and a hint of mocha on the finish. Tightly compacted tannins and brisk acidity need time to unwind. Drink after 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a rich and juicy wine, balancing the firm tannins of the Baga with richer fruitiness of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Roriz. It is still young, still showing layers of firm tannins although with plenty of development potential. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine offers a tight nose of cherry cola and petrol. It opens on the palate by featuring flavors of smoked meat, eucalyptus, cherry, and ripe peach. Lush tannins contribute a fatty umami sensation to the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of mature berry, aromatic herb and fragrant iris lead the nose while the ripe palate offers mature black cherry, licorice and pipe tobacco. Firm, velvety tannins provide the framework. Showing the heat of the vintage, the fruit is already evolved so drink this sooner rather than later.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A few swirls of the glass release subtle aromas of tilled soil, underbrush, violet, leather and a whiff of menthol. The firm palate offers mature black cherry, licorice and a hint of cinnamon alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of children's vitamins, corn stalk and white peach set up a lemony stony zesty palate with lemon and nectarine flavors. A stony crisp cleansing finish does the job while not faltering.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Loamy berry, cheesy oak, balsamic hints and vanilla notes make for an interesting bouquet. This feels a bit wiry and acidic at its core, while overall it's chunky in stature. Deep warming flavors of kirsch and blackberry finish with heat and jammy weight. Drink through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of black cherry, smoked meat and thyme prepare the taste buds for flavors of black cherry, smoked meat, oregano, and lemon zest with notes of dark chocolate. Soft yet persistent tannins coat the palate, culminating in a delightfully bright finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Enticing spicy, toasty aromas and robust, dry fruit flavors are matched by very firm, fine-grained tannins in this full-bodied wine. Based on 65% Zinfandel, it has lots to offer, but at this stage an oaky sensation and the astringent mouthfeel indicate that it needs to mellow. Best to drink after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy and full-bodied, this offers aromas of truffle, scorched earth, leather, game and mature black-skinned fruit.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Funky but not unpleasant aromas of game, scorched earth and cured meat are joined by whiffs of wild berry and leather. The palate shows dried cherry, aniseed, and grilled sage alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to enjoy the remaining fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offers aromas of pressed rose, cherry marinated in spirits, aromatic herb and menthol. The bracing palate shows raw red cherry, clove, white pepper and a hint of mocha while assertive tannins and racy acidity provide the framework. It's still young and aggressively tannic so don't attempt before 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This solid Barolo opens with aromas of mature dark berry, licorice, clove, chewing tobacco and a whiff of crushed flower. The palate reveals red cherry, strawberry, white pepper and thyme alongside bracing tannins. Drink after 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While the texture is light, the fruit and the wood flavors give this wine richness and a ripe, toast and apricot character. It has balanced acidity that allows a fresher edge to develop. The aftertaste, hinting at a steely edge, suggests the wine will age. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The spicy aromas resemble black pepper and anise. Fruit flavors are ripe and delicious, and the creamy texture seems to melt in the mouth. This wine offers lots of personality and very good balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark in color, this Mencía smells of turned earth, roots, herbs, dried cheese, tobacco and baked black fruits. It's round and chunky on the palate, but cobbled together at its foundation. Ripe blackberry and raspberry flavors come with vanilla and creamy notes in front of an ephemeral finish. Drink through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of resin, nail polish, overripe plum steeped in spirits, oak and a confectionary note lead the way. The warm palate displays ripe black cherry, cocoa, anise and a whisper of licorice framed in velvety tannins. Drink through 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While the nose is a touch earthy and savory, the core of this vivacious Riesling boasts spicy dried orange peels, tangerine and honey. Lemonade acidity leads a moderately long finish. It's a thirst quenching fresh wine to drink young.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This firm red offers aromas of underbrush, French oak, exotic spice, dried rose and a balsamic whiff of menthol. On the full-bodied palate, a bracing tannic backbone supports dried black cherry, coconut, licorice, roasted coffee bean and oak-driven spice. Drink 2019–2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of charred earth, forest floor, truffle, sage and mature berry lead the nose. The brawny palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, clove and tobacco alongside tightly packed tannins. You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol. Give the tannins a few more years to unclench then drink to capture the remaining fruit richness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Snappy citric aromas of grapefruit and lime are pungent and not too different from Verdejo or Sauvignon Blanc. Accordingly, the palate is fresh and focused, with flavors of stone fruits that are leesy and have a honeyed sweetness. A controlled, mild finish tastes mostly of orange. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Layered aromas of blackberry, cassis, leather and dried cheese are inviting. In the mouth, this Garnacha from vines more than 100-years-old is jammy and friendly. Candied almost syrupy flavors of blackberry and black cherry finish dense and chocolaty, with modest acidity. Drink through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of baked plum, mocha, toast and sweet pipe tobacco drive the nose while the palate offers palate offers dried black cherry marinated in spirits, vanilla, nutmeg and leather. A note of dried sage closes the finish while austere tannins provide bracing support. Drink 2019–2029.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark berry, tilled earth and gamey aromas lift out of the glass. The firm palate offers black cherry, chocolate, peppermint and oak alongside tightly packed tannins that leave an astringent finish. Drink after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Simple and delicious, this vibrant, mouthwatering red doles out fleshy black cherry, crushed blueberry, ground pepper and clove alongside polished tannins. An almond note graces the finish. This makes a fantastic everyday wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A lacy spray of sweetness extends from start to finish on this fruity, fresh Kabinett. Fresh apple, pear and tangerine are honeyed and lip smacking, energized by a streak of lemonade acidity on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of pressed violet, ripe berry, menthol and a touch of exotic spice emerge on this full-bodied red. Showing its hot-vintage origins, the firm palate doesn't boast a lot of fruit richness but offers licorice, espresso, powdered sage and dried cherry accompanied by bracing, grainy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is smoky, ripe and packed with tannins. The fruit gives the wine weight although it is not yet fully developed. There is a toasty background to this rich wine with its juicy red-berry fruits and acidity. Drink from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is ripe with yellow fruits and rich pears. It has a rounded character, with a creamy texture shot through with acidity. The aftertaste has touches of grapefruit and a minerality that gives good texture. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Some smoke and crushed boysenberry play on nose and palate. The pleasant smokiness reaches into all corners of this soft but fresh wine. It has a lovely rounded balance despite the relatively light body where earthiness is as present as fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plenty of wood flavors give this wine a ripe, spicy and toasty character. It is rich and perfumed, with attractive hints of yellow fruits as well as the new wood. The wood does need to calm down before the wine is ready. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is firm and structured, with complex tannins and dark black-fruit flavors. Under the tannins, juicy fruit with considerable acidity gives signs of great potential. The aftertaste again comes back to the structure. Drink from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The first take on this Rioja Reserva is of charred wood, then that's backed up by piercing aromas of cherry and plum. This feels hard and abrasive, but powerful. Flavors of roasted plum, tomato and herbs finish with grating tannins and a lemony oak flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This hefty but sluggish Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend opens with forceful aromas of earthy, herbal red-berry fruits and sweet oak. Chunky, thick and almost syrupy in feel, this tastes of herbal plum and spiced berry fruits. The longer it rests, the fatter and chunkier it gets. This warm-vintage has weight issues.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Much care goes into this blend, which was fermented both in neutral wood and in stainless steel. Just 10% went through malolactic. It's a light, clean, well-defined effort, offering accents of salad greens, celery and lemon verbena around crisp apple fruit flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Vines from high up in the vineyard produce this cool, fresh wine. It has bright acidity along with intense grapefruit and lemon fruits. The wine is tangy with a strong texture. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Citrus, Mediterranean herb and cut grass aromas lead the way. The crisp palate offers Bartlett pear, unripe apricot and grapefruit alongside tangy acidity. A saline note backs up the succulent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Grassy stone fruit and lime zest paint a pretty picture in this full-bodied white, which retains enough acidity to stay refreshing and bright on the palate. Floral tinges of tangerine blossom and lemongrass finish things out.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy, beefy, almost metallic aromas, then beefy, tamarind-like flavors make an exotic but rustic profile for this fascinating medium-bodied wine. The texture is rather lean and a tasty sour-cherry character develops on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This light-golden colored wine has an appealing combo of fruit and spice flavors and a rich but lively texture to make it both tasty and appetizing. It has the creaminess and unctuousness that many people love while balancing it with fresh acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A healthy 20% of Merlot provides additional softness in this food-friendly, well-integrated wine, bright in crisp cranberry and mellowed oak and tannin. Well-made at a fair price, it's well worth the seek.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This medium-bodied Shiraz represents a solid value. Sourced from 80 growers, it's meant to present a “portrait” of the Barossa region, and it delivers vanilla, plum and black olive aromas and flavors, supple tannins and a lingering mocha finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas recalling hay, yellow flower, dried herb and a light vegetal note carry over to the bright, medium-bodied palate along with lime and green apple. A flinty mineral note underscores the vibrant flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fruit is sourced from multiple sites, including Sangiacomo and Rancho Salina for this elegant wine which is slight in black and blue fruit with a subtle notion of leather. Structurally, it has a deep complexity of tannins that remains integrated on the back of the palate. It's ready for the table.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a tasty, appetizing, classic Rhône-style blend that starts with savory, peppery aromas, fills in meaty sour-cherry flavors and has a lightly tannic texture and medium body. It's a good wine to stock at home, and will be versatile with food. Made from 73% Grenache, plus Mourvèdre and Syrah.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Grapefruit, lemon and star anise aromas lead this refined but friendly wine. On the palate, lush, rounded flavors of melon and tropical fruit are supported by brisk acidity. Great combination with richer poultry or pork dishes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "One of the rarer grapes in California, this bottling shows composting roses, raw and roasted beef, violets and tar on the nose. It's quite rich on the sip, with blueberries, blackberries and olallieberry-pie flavors, cut by tangy cherry skins and a touch of milk chocolate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Baked lemon, jasmine and honeyed Pink Lady apples open the nose of this bottling, a special anniversary project for the usually Rhône-only winery. Lighter flavors of lemon zest and crisp apple flesh sit atop a chalky grip, making for a wine that would work well with a variety of lighter foods.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Packed with fruit, this is a ripe, rich wine. Red berries are cut with attractive citrus flavors. Full in the mouth and with a good tannic character, this is a wine for food, especially spicy dishes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "You'll find aromas of dried orchard fruit, beeswax, Spanish broom, acacia and an earthy note on this spry nine-year-old. On the mature, waxy palate, fruit flavors have given way to tertiary sensations of honey, toasted nut, candied citrus zest and flinty mineral that carry through the to lingering finish. A saline note signals the close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This appealing wine offers threads of pine needle, sage and parsley, augmenting a clean core of apple and white peach fruit. The complexity is compelling, and the length impressive, though it fades just a little too much to stand up to long term aging.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crushed lavender, herbs de Provence, white pepper, raw game and leather elements show on the complex nose of this mountaintop bottling. The palate shows dried beef and dense berry flavors bolstered by black pepper and bay leaf spices.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich and elegant aromas of black cherry, blueberry, vanilla, lilacs and Concord grape show on the nose of this wine. The palate is complex, with pencil lead, black pepper, elderberry, milk chocolate and bloody meat flavors, bound by a strong tannic structure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Grapefruit blossoms, lime zest, lemonade and chilled green apple slices show on the fresh and citrusy nose of this bottling. Tangy lime and richer pear flesh notes lead the palate, where a salty character cuts through the juiciness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Warm, furry aromas of olive, prune and animal hide are challenging. In the mouth, this cool-year Carmenère feels tartaric and narrow, with grating tannins. Fiery flavors of black fruits, raisin and oak are mildly salty and herbal, while the finish feels hot and tastes of minty oak and black fruits.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This coastal-influenced Chardonnay smells of green olive, iodine and sea brine more than fruit. A citric, high-intensity palate is chalky and minerally, as intended. Flavors of dried, briny stone fruits and apple are outright salty like the ocean, while the finish on this new wine from chalk-based soils is woody and briny, with juicy acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Springtime in a bottle! This is fairly bursting with aromas of fruit and flower, and carries them into bright strawberry flavors with a gentle touch of sweetness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of flaky piecrust, spiced apple and macadamia nut are vivid and alluring. Medium to full in body, this proves to have both flesh and spine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raspberry and cherry aromas are juicy and wiry, with no fat at all. Pure, simple berry flavors come with a touch of spice, while the finish is short yet juicy. An easy-drinking and approachable selection.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Black cherry fruit is encased in dark barrel flavors of smoke, charcoal and espresso. Tart acids tighten up the finish. It's got plenty of power, but the fruit seems over-matched by the oak, at least at this young stage.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This crisp, clean Chardonnay is a good find for $20. Fruity with a suggestive note of caramel on the nose, it delivers a taste of citrus and green apple on the palate that evolves into a satisfying finish that's entirely tropical.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This firm wine has a strong element of dry tannin that masks the fruit. It feels cool, fresh and rather hard now. It needs to age until 2015 when it will become a richer, fuller wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plum and berry aromas are mildly jammy. This is fast moving on the palate, with racy acidity pushing berry flavors that veer toward tartness but pull back in time. An aggressive finish is also almost sour but not, while oaky coffee and bitter chocolate flavors wrap it up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Oak, toast, coffee, espresso, chocolate and vanilla sensations dominate this wine along with notes of black plum. There's not enough fruit richness to stand up to the oak or the astringent wood tannins on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Delicate red-cherry and raspberry aromas pick up touches of tobacco and turmeric. On first sip, the palate is charming and elegant, if a tad slender. But pop the wine into a decanter and it puts on some weight, becoming fleshier.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spunky, youthful aromas of wild berry and currant are aggressive but fresh in style. This is a juicy, forward, bright Malbec with boysenberry flavors followed by a short wave of bitter chocolate and toast. It finishes in the same style.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is a strong barnyard aroma here, although the palate is cleaner and more modern. With rich tannins and a dark plum character, it's ripe and structured. There is a strong mineral element, giving the wine power and density. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This rich wine conveys flavors of milk chocolate and ripe black plums. It is smooth, velvet-textured and full in the mouth. Acidity and firm tannins are a fine supporting cast to the black fruit flavors at the end. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is soft, rounded, showing light acidity and fresh fruit. Melons and pears dominate the ripe flavors, with a touch of almonds and rich aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This well-balanced wine is both fruity and structured. It has good acidity, blackberry juice flavors and a bright aftertaste. It can be drunk now–2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is firm, dominated by black currant fruit and a strongly tannic character. That gives fresh fruitiness that is contained within a solid, structure. The wine will need time to round out. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wood-laden wine shows more toast than fruit at this stage. It does have plenty of blackberry flavors for the future, giving texture to the firm structure. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It has attractive acidity and fragrant, juicy fruitiness. Underneath this fruit is a solid structure, fine tannins and fresh final acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a more rustic, woody Cabernet than many from Mendoza. The nose suggests asphalt, herbs and spice more than bright fruit. A tannic yet solid body and flavors of coffee, herbs lead to a finish that tastes dry and a bit hollow, with coffee and cocoa notes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crisp and herbaceous, it has a riper background of yellow fruit fleshiness. It's bright and likely to soften and round out into 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bold and fruity, this saignée-style rosé is 75% Syrah and 25% Pinot Noir. Tart, tangy, primary fruit flavors of watermelon, strawberry and cranberry fill the mouth, turning just a little bit sour in the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From Sonoma and Napa-grown grapes, this white combines fresh peach and apricot flavor with a taste of grapefruit and fresh-squeezed lime. Through the middle it veers into vanilla and tropical swirls, before finishing crisp.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raspberry and plum aromas are mild and entirely fresh. This is your typical cosecha wine with plenty of fruit and giddy-up. Punchy plum and cherry flavors finish with controlled bitterness and a spot of burnt toast.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of quince, piecrust and apricot transfer onto the palate, which feels soft, round and intense. Notes of apricot and white strawberry cobbler mark the slightly off-dry finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This starts out leafy and earthy, but improves with airing. A lively palate delivers herbal plum and berry flavors along with ample spice. The finish is bold and bright initially, transitioning to tight and peppery.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Serbian white has notes of fresh cut grass, lime peel and mango on the nose, and tropical fruit flavors like mango and guava on the palate. The finish is  nice and crisp with good acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This has aromas of vanilla, plum and black raspberry. In the mouth, there are ripe fruit flavors followed by a wave of tart cherry flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine comes from a small vineyard close to Margaux, but only with the lowly Bordeaux appellation. It is ripe, full and rich, with smooth tannins and an approachable character. Red fruits dominate, along with wood flavors. The acidity at the end gives a lift.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Compact berry and plum aromas set up a solid, nice palate with nectarine and raspberry flavors. This is very drinkable and easygoing; the finish is mellow but propped up by core acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rounder and less textured than a Sancerre, this style of Menetou-Salon makes a fine alternative Sauvignon Blanc. It's full and ripe, fresh with acidity while also bringing some tropical fruits into play. It's ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's plenty of dark chocolate and full-throttled blueberry fruit in this Petite Sirah from a producer with a longstanding history with the grape. Subtle yet chewy black pepper plays on the palate, finishing in a waft of smoke.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light in color and weight, it's earthy in pastoral mushrooms and forest floor. Layers of spicy clove twirl throughout the palate aided by a juicy strawberry bouquet and a restrained touch of oak on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Layered botrytis that gives the wine both its richness and dense texture. It is sweet but with a dry core and crisp acidity, it will age well. It is going to be a beautiful wine, with tropical fruits, apricots and wonderful final acidity. Drink from 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose is a blend of peach and earth. The palate comes with great intensity, holding against the sweetness with an exquisitely delicious streak of quinine bitterness which lends direction and precision, along with tangy lemon freshness. This creates ample tension and moreishness as well as a lip-smacking medium-sweet finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Generosity, expressed by the scent of sun-ripened Bosc pear peel, becomes immediately apparent. The ripe and luscious pear aromatics pervade the palate with their fruity, almost floral charm. There is some residual sweetness, boosting these flavors even more, but balance is struck by shining freshness and a pear-peel texture to finish with beguiling freshness. This is textbook stuff and utterly moreish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the BudBreak Vineyard, this lengthy and complex wine is bold and fresh—an exploration of cranberry and orange flavors complemented by spicy acidity. It continues to unveil itself in the glass, revealing additional components of toasted oak and forest mushroom.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Meant to impart the meaning of the “true” Sonoma Coast, this bottling hails from Campbell Ranch near Annapolis. It impresses with its lush complexity: cherry grenadine and forest floor scents, with cardamom spice and a hint of orange peel. It's full-bodied and densely powerful.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Enticing floral, wild berry, new leather and truffle aromas seemingly float out of the glass, growing darker with spice as the wine takes on air. The palate is elegant and still youthfully austere, offering Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and white pepper flavors, framed by firm, chewy tannins and vibrant acidity. A licorice note closes the lingering finish. Drink 2020–2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a terrific discovery from a tiny winery and remote hilltop vineyard near the Pacific Coast. It's deep in color, with aromas evocative of forest floor, rhubarb and rosemary. The palate is woven in structure and enticing fruit and spice flavors. Balance, complexity and moderate tannins combine in an attractive profile and unique personality.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This producer gets the entirety of this vineyard's three acres of grapes, showing off the site in the clarity of its black tea and rose petal aromas. Silky in texture and light on the palate, it puts on a tenacious sideshow of pine and black pepper scents.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The purest, freshest note of lemon zest and lemon oil creates a dreamy nose. The palate brings in a stony texture that characterizes the entire wine. There is something enduring and stone-like about this, framed with lovely lemon purity. This has barely had time to express itself. There is more to be had from this wine in the future. The long echoes of stone and citrus promise that. Drink 2020–2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The term Vintner's Select, which is unregulated, can be abused. Here it really means something, as this is the winery's top cuvée—an excellent effort that spent 18 months in oak. There's extra depth in the cherry and cassis fruit, packing a powerful, compact punch all the way through a long, polished finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache and Petite Sirah is quite dark in the glass, with blueberry, sharp cedar, clove and vanilla aromas. It coats the palate with soft, lavish tannins, offering zesty black fruit with cappuccino, teriyaki and cracked pepper flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intense aromatics of plum, cherry and red currant introduce this wine. There's a whiff of pencil lead, and the bold fruit flavors capture a bit of brush and bramble along with perfect, clean ripeness. A suggestion of candle wax comes up. This is a powerful wine that continually demands your attention.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tight and concentrated, this is a very fine wine. Great acidity and great tannins go with the most intense fruit. Blackberry and black-cherry flavors power through this structured wine. There is also elegance and a fine sense of style. Drink from 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is another stunner from Pellet Estate, from a high-elevation vineyard within the proposed Petaluma Gap appellation, which is highly influenced by fog and wind. Wet stone notes and a crisp, lemony acidity suggest freshness, neither detracting from body or texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Layered black cherry, cola and raspberry flavors laced with cardamom and clove make this medium-bodied red succulently memorable. It's balanced and forgiving, its supple texture yielding to a creaminess on the finish that's irresistible.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This plump Pinot Noir uses 20% new French oak to deliver nutmeg, gingerbread spice and licorice aromas. Black cherry and raspberry round out the nose and integrate on the palate, which is hearty and rich in Christmas spice and crushed rock notes. An excellent choice for anyone seeking a full-figured Pinot.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sharp lime and pithy grapefruit notes accented by sour cream, chalk and limestone lead the nose of this wine from the pioneering Talley family. Nectarine, sea salt and Gravenstein apple flavors play on the palate, which strikes a happy balance between savory and tart, finishing with buttery depth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intense citrus is overlaid by the ripe pineapple and tropical fruit. This delicious complex wine, with its tangy acidity, tightly coiled texture and touches of wood aging, is packed with great fruit. Drink from 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a small, 10-acre property, owned by the Moueix family, at the heart of the Pomerol plateau. With its 30% Cabernet Franc it is perfumed and ripe, giving delicious black fruits as well as a firmer structure. The wine is set for a long aging with great potential. Drink from 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose is reminiscent of the yellow and aromatic peel of ripe apples. It even has a touch of mirabelle. The palate continues in the same fruit-driven vein with that pure, ripe but tart apple note that seems to be such a feature of Alsace Riesling. The palate is dry and has a fine-boned structure that almost crunches in the mouth. A pure lemon note makes for a very clean-cut finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earth, apple and citrus align on the nose. The palate brings out more earthiness but also pits the notions of mellow baked apple against absolutely tart lemon freshness. Stone and earth cling constantly to these flavors and draw you in. The palate is pure and slender, totally dry and taut. The finish is of lasting lemon zest. This needs time but is full of promise. Drink 2020–2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tingly acidity complements the lush, full-bodied concentration of this estate-grown beauty. It's both soft and sensual in tone. Pine, orange peel and pomegranate notes play against the richness and add freshness to the chewy tannin. Best enjoyed 2024 through 2034.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "Big, bold and ripe, this is a rich wine with its 82% Merlot. It is jammy while keeping its tannins and structure. Ripe and full in the mouth, the wine is firm enough to age for a long time. It is going to be generous, full and ripe. Drink from 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a tightly coiled wine, still firm and packed with tannins as well as fruit. It has a strong dry core that is lifted by the bright acidity. This is going to be a very complete wine, all the elements well in place. Drink from 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This rich wine has a good proportion (31%) of Cabernet Franc to give it a perfumed structured character. It is dense and with considerable tannins at this stage. By contrast, the fruit has enormous potential with rich blackberry and black-plum flavors. This chateau has made a considerable stride in this vintage. Drink from 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A remarkable effort, especially considering how difficult the 2011 vintage was in South Australia. Floral notes emerge on the nose, dressing up hints of raspberry compote, while the medium- to full-bodied palate delivers raspberries, cherries, cinnamon, clove and pepper. The tannins on the finish are fine and silky. Drink now–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Totally sumptuous peach notes dance on nose and palate. They are boosted by plump sweetness and given shape by zesty freshness. Everything about this is opulent and intense. The freshness of 2014 makes it lip smacking and bright, despite all of its richness. This finishes medium sweet while the peachy flavors last and last.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A pure startling cherry note rises from the glass. It is flanked by notes of autumn forest, tar and dried orange rind. Evidently, there is some development and evolution here. The palate is alive and fills not only the mouth but all the senses with its alluring aromas, yet it is firmly anchored in earthier tones. The body is svelte and fresh: its fine-boned structure is as much down to fresh acidity as it is to finely flexed tannins. This is profound, lasting and delicious but also deliciously light.\n",

      "Glorious apple freshness jumps from the glass, there is the slightest touch of honey, too. On the palate, the apple notions persist: there is fresh and baked apple, adding both crisp and mellow notes. Everything is brightened by lemony freshness on a concentrated but elegant and balanced body. Flavors last and have a long, clean and bone-dry finish. This is good enough to go the mileage. Drink now through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an exceptional vintage for La Croix. It has voluptuous fruits that emerge from the ripe dense tannins. They are balanced by intense acidity and a crisp edge. The wine, with its still stylish character, is one to age for a long time. Drink this very fine wine from 2025\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Produced from 25-year-old vines in a six-acre parcel, this is a soft, ripe, red-fruit-flavored wine. Wood aging is noticeable in the smoky character of the wine and the ripe tannins. Otherwise, the juicy, fresh fruit dominates. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This plump, dry rosé features hints of wet stone, strawberry and barely ripe melon. It's vibrant, refreshing and an ideal thirst-quencher for the warm months ahead.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made with 100% Sangiovese, this savory red delivers aromas of black cherry, scorched earth and chopped herb. The palate offers crushed blackberry, juicy cherry and black pepper. Fine-grained tannins provide support.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a steely, smoky wine derived from flint soil. It is crisply fresh, tight and nervy with a strong tang of acidity as well as good intensity. It needs to age, so drink from late 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lavish on the nose, this wine, made by a blind classical pianist, shows aromas of blackcurrant, caramel and hickory smoke. The heavy smoke on the nose fades away once sipped, and the palate proves quite grippy and tightly wound, showing tar, black pepper, teriyaki, black plum and cocoa-dust flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of blueberry jam, scorched earth, leather, truffle and coffee lead the way on this ripe, accessible wine. The chewy palate offers fleshy blackberry, anise, toast, espresso and a confectionary note alongside mature but rather fleeting tannins. Drink 2016–2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A straightforward, modern dry Riesling, this wine shows a slight hint of gasoline, citrus blossoms, wet river stones and apple skin on the nose. The mouthfeel is more full than Mike Callahan's other bottlings, with waxy citrus skins, lime pith, sour apple, alkaline elements and a touch of white jasmine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark cherry red in color, this blend of Cinsault, Grenache Noir, Syrah and Tempranillo features a bouquet of cherry with a hint of green pepper. Flavors of raspberry, pomegranate, orange peel and spearmint are set in a web of soft tannins that fully announce themselves at the mouth-coating, minty finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cherry and plum, chocolate and peppery herbs combine here in a well-structured wine with some years of life ahead. Aged in one-third new French oak for 11 months, it will reward decanting or aeration if you are drinking it in the next year or two.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cabernet Sauvignon (68%) takes the lead, with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Malbec rounding it out. High-toned aromas of graphite, herbs, black cherry, espresso and barrel spices lead to tart flavors that are lighter in style, with the tannins providing some grip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from 89% of the indigenous grape Karasakiz and 11% Merlot, this wine presents scents of strawberry and orange blossom. It comes on bright with flavors of cherry and clementine, but as smooth tannins coat the mouth, notes of anise, violet and smoke join the chorus. The finish is also bright, with lingering flavors of smoke and flowers.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crushed blue flower, ripe plum and baking spice are some of the aromas you'll find on this polished red. The round, chewy palate offers ripe black cherry, cinnamon and white pepper alongside sleek tannins. Drink soon to capture the juicy fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark berry, vanilla, roasted coffee bean and toast aromas waft out of the glass. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, anise, espresso and oak-driven spice alongside grippy tannins that leave an astringent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from a majority of Cabernet Franc, this wine is blended with 11% Cabernet Sauvignon and 1% Syrah. The fruit comes from the winery's estate vineyard in Rutherford as well as from Stagecoach Vineyard in Atlas Peak. Initially smoky, it reveals pockets of cedar and herb before unleashing juicy black cherry, chocolate and dusty, big tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Strikes of lime cut through rich honey and tangerine flavors in this dry, revitalizing Riesling. Hints of smoked nuts, pollen and dusty mineral lend savory complexity to the midpalate, but the finish is pristine and perfumed, lingering on a lovely honeysuckle note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bringing together fruit from the different soils of Pouilly Fumé, this rich wine offers pear and apricot flavors as well as a strong citrus element. It also is a smoky, steely wine with a firm texture that underlies the fruit. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is intense, herbal and aromatic. The palate shows some rounded citrus and yellow-fruit flavors although green gooseberry comes through strongly. It is fresh, floral and deliciously ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is red-violet in colour and has a nose of raspberry and fennel. There is a nice interplay of medium-weight tannins and bright acidity, with flavors of cranberry, tart cherry, chocolate and flint. The zesty finish is followed by the lingering presence of soft tannins on the tongue and gums.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from the local grapes Bogazkere and Öküzgözü, this wine features aromas of black cherry, white chocolate and orange peel. A bright cherry flavor with notes of orange zest is set against a more complex backdrop of cooked cherries with touches of mocha and eucalyptus. Smooth, long-lasting tannins linger on the palate, joined by a final burst of pomegranate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This cherry-red wine is made from 100% Kadarka and has aromas of cherry, dried cherry, black pepper and cherry cola. It greets the palate with tastes of dark chocolate and tart dried cherry while finishingly lively.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "One of this new appellation's strongest showings, this Sémillon offers dried apple, dried mango, smoke and strawberry blossoms aromas on the nose. The palate is very intriguing, with flavors of roasted apples and pears, squeezed lime, lemon rinds and a sprinkle of vanilla on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "HandCraft has been consistently good with this grape, and this complex wine is another excellent example. Intriguing aromas of wood smoke and rosemary lead to concentrated fruit flavors like pomegranate and cranberry. The mouthfeel is layered and nicely tannic, and flavors seem to go deep.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mancini has 20% Carignane field-blended within, and shows burly, thick black fruit at its core. Integrated oak supports black cherry and pepper. A dustiness on the palate that finishes ripe.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From White Hawk Vineyard near Los Alamos, this wine has a nose that is both edgy with tangerine rind and ripe with warmer crème brûlée notes. The palate plays the same trick, welcoming with broad white peach, Japanese pear and vanilla-cream flavors, yet clinging to a zesty line of lime pith throughout.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lifted and floral up front, this Mencía smells like light, schist-infused plum and raspberry. There's mild grab to the palate, which offers flavors of buttery oak, rubber, strawberry and rose hip. A dry, slightly briny tasting finish fades away elegantly.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mossy, earthy, lightly stewed plum and berry aromas come with accents of peppery spice and olive. In the mouth, grabby tannins attack the cheeks, while flavors of plum, tomato and prune finish with a reprise of cheek-assaulting, hard tannins. Drink through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soy, black fruit and asphalt aromas are strong on the nose of this wine by the Four Sisters project. The palate is varietally pure, with black pepper, tar and boysenberry. It dives a bit deeper as well, showing coffee and dark chocolate character.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This provides a very good example of the varietal in a velvety-smooth style. It tastes dry but generous, nicely balanced and just tannic enough to be appetizing. Flavors are a warm combination of berries, light spices and a touch of oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light gold to the eye, this wine features a bouquet of pineapple, chopped parsley and baking bread. It is full on the palate, blending Seckel pear, Granny Smith apple and fresh mint. It is cooling in the throat, and the lingering finish offers a wave of bright acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Austere, this needs time in the glass to unwind and develop into the full-bodied, more exuberant wine it becomes, a mix of cedar, thyme and leather. At first unpenetrable, the tannin softens into smooth layers of black plum and pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This tastes and feels mellow and approachable, with gentle aromas of plums, dried herbs and tomato, and medium body with moderate tannins. It is supple and easy to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A red blend from the eastern end of the Entre deux Mers region, this is a smooth and already accessible wine. Attractive black fruits and soft tannins accompany touches of vanilla. It's ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bright, fresh and fruity wine presents an appealing mix of apricot and peach aromas, ripe and round peach flavors and a smooth texture. Rather full bodied, it is lifted by a good amount of tangy acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This full-bodied, concentrated wine is dry, quite firm and tannic in texture. It smells rich and a bit earthy, and tastes like blackberries, cranberries and beef. The style will accompany rich, meaty food very well.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A serious personality comes from oaky, earthy aromas and flavors, a bit of welcome astringency and good acidity. It seems full bodied, dry and rich enough in texture to be appealing without losing the tanginess underneath.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mostly Malbec (34%) and Petit Verdot (32%), this nonvintage blend offers up-front oak notes of vanilla and dill. These are followed by cherry cola, green herbs and a whiff of volatility, along with sweet flavors and grippy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light and fruity, this smells like cucumbers, honeydew melon and green apple, tastes delicately appley and feels gentle in texture. It's light bodied, low in alcohol, fresh and thirst-quenching.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe, brambly notes accentuate luscious blackberry and cassis flavors in this fleshy, full-bodied red blend. It's a straightforward wine with baby-soft tannins underlining its forward, fruity style.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made in an obviously oaky style, this has spicy, smoky vanilla and nutmeg aromas, plus equally high-intensity and almost sweet flavors. A relatively smooth texture accompanies the full body. Generous and ripe fruit flavors come out with each sip and add depth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of Syrah (46%), Malbec (27%), Merlot (20%) and Cabernet Franc, this conveys dried and fresh herbs, cherry, woodspice and coffee. It's supple in feel backed by tart acidity and rather dry tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mounds Bar-like barrel notes dominate the plummy, slightly raisined-seeming fruit found on this 100% varietal wine. The lighter fruit flavors of the vintage can't match the oak's intensity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light in color for a Cabernet, this conveys black currant, fresh blackberries and coffee. It's a bit thin in the middle but remains pleasant and straightforward on the edges.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Heavy wood aromas are mitigated on the palate by the ripe fruit, making for a rich wine with black plum flavors as well as a core of tannins. It's going to develop well and quickly, so drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is lean, more about structure than tannins. Some juicy fruitiness is overwhelmed by the dry core of the wine that seems over-extracted.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Attractive and balanced, this has light tannins and fresh black currant fruitiness. Everything is in the right place, correct if not more. The aftertaste has a good, food-friendly acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This austere wine is almost skeletal in character. It offers plenty of tannins and structure and not much fruit. The wine feels hard and tough.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Marked by red berry fruits and soft tannins, this has a juicy character, with touches of wood aging that are already integrated. The aftertaste, with its fresh currant acidity and rounded fruit, shows that this will be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A plush ripeness pushes on the palate, with a taste of baked apple and tropical fruit that falls flat somewhat on the finish, its layers of oaky vanilla disappearing in a mist.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine offers notes of peach, honeysuckle and lime leaf. It's sweet and lightly spritzy in feel, with lavender flavors on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine comes from Château le Gardera on the slopes above the Garonne river in the Entre-deux-Mers region. It's a big, wood-aged and spicy wine that's full of attractive red berry fruits. There is a dry core of tannin, so the wine could age although it is quite ready to drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This mild-flavored wine delivers light apple, floral, almond and maraschino-cherry flavors, a smooth, soft texture and medium body. Although subtle, it does develop more complexity in the glass.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This nicely fruity, fresh wine presents a blend of apple, floral and slightly sweet flavors wrapped in a pleasing texture. Medium bodied, it tastes like a colorful fruit bowl concentrated into one glass.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Caramelized apples and toasted squash-seed aromas arise from this wine, which offers good zing but a more oxidized style on the palate. Flavors of nut-based syrups, dried citrus and slightly sour orange juice arise once sipped.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Syrah is fairly weak on the nose, with black cherry, dark spice and crushed rocks emerging with steady swirling. Purple fruits and graphite minerality show up on the palate, but this wine still needs time to come out of its shell.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This medium-bodied blend conveys cocoa, raspberries, green herbs and bell pepper. Green flavors take the lead backed by lightly astringent tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A whiff of matchstick figures prominently on the nose in this intense white, which was stainless-steel fermented and aged. Nonetheless it takes on the taste of wood and preserved lemon, finishing on a bittersweet note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wood aging is still showing in this young wine that needs time. Dry, firm and toasty, it also has the light, fruity character of the 2013 vintage with raspberry, blueberry and acidity that's still too intense. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The barrel aromas of vanilla and coconut are far out front of the fruit on this blend of Petite Sirah (40%), Zinfandel (33%), Lemberger (20%) and Syrah. It's full bodied with the wood overwhelming any sense of varietal flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The volatility on this wine is distracting. It's a shame because it's otherwise well constructed with notes of Red Vines, vanilla and cherry, with a palate-coating feel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of pencils shavings, menthol and grilled herb lead to a palate that opens with bright red berry and herbaceous notes. Green, astringent tannins create an abrupt finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The two signature white grapes of Côtes de Gascogne give a wine flavored with tropical fruit and honey. It is delicate, ripe and just off dry. The wine is ready to drink although it will be better at the end of 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mild, clean aromas of dusty apple, lees and peach set up a creamy, full palate with low acidity and moderate definition. Papaya and melon are the lead flavors, while the finish is melony and oily, with low acidity and not much, if any, minerality.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Strongly wood and toast laden, this is a dense and tannic wine with a complex structure that dominates the blackberry fruits. It is firm and, although it can be drunk now for its rich structure, will be better from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In the Alentejo, Syrah exhibits power, body and concentration without much subtlety. So this wine is solid, tannic with considerable pepper and spice flavors that dominate the black fruits. Wood aging has softened the tannins. Acidity gives the wine a fresher finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Despite its youth this is quickly peaking in flavor. It's light but interesting, with rosewater, red apple and strawberry flavors. Tannins are soft and there's a suggestion of saddle leather. It offers plenty of enjoyment for a Pinot at this price.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a barrel-selection reserve, with unusual scents of pine needles and baking spices co-mingled. Deep cassis and dark chocolate flavors prevail, and the tannins have not yet softened and smoothed. Give this a few more years of bottle age.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fruit flavors of blue plum and blueberry are matched to a light layer of chocolate from aging in 30% new French oak. It's smooth and polished, but feels a bit stripped as it fades out, leaving some orange-flavored acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Classic varietal aromas of pear flesh and skin open into just slightly underripe fruit flavors. The wine is balanced and adds tart apple to the pear fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Polkura's first value-priced Syrah opens with earthy black-fruit aromas that are thick yet not precise in character. The palate feels wide, chunky and not particularly elegant. Flavors of baking spice and herbal blackberry finish peppery and chunky, with a touch of resiny oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soft, ripe and juicy, this wine is full of ready-to-drink fruit housed by soft tannins from light wood aging. Mainly fruit-forward in style, a bright acidity kicks on the finish to balance the palate out.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a hard, edgy and tannic wine that has a bitter edge overlaying the fruit. It seems tough, although there are hints of ripe berry fruits that are hiding away. Some softening over the next year will offer integration. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Like most Leyda Sauv Blancs, this pops with cool-climate aromas of bell pepper and grapefruit. It's narrow on the palate, with razor-sharp acidity and green tannins. Bell pepper and briny citrus flavors finish sharp, with a touch of sourness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Squeezed lemon rinds and a faint whiff of petrol show on an otherwise reluctant nose from this off-dry wine. The palate reveals a racy, finely focused acidity that zings across the palate, hiding the residual sugar at first before allowing the ripe nectarine and apple soufflé elements to carry the flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bright and engaging wine looks quite deep in color, smells jammy, tastes fresh, young and gushing with ripe blackberry and blueberry flavors. It's not too tannic, not too full-bodied, appropriately dry and easy to enjoy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This has a dark red-black color, with densely packed aromas that seem so tight they are not giving up much. Flavors of concentrated dark plum and white pepper are interlaced with very firm tannins. It's full bodied, young and wound up tight. Drink it now for the wow factor, or be adventurous and save it until 2020 to see how much more flavor complexity develops.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Densely brambly in red and black berry ripeness, this wine from a superb, high-elevation vineyard site is soft through the midpalate, before revealing megawatts of power and oak on the back of the tongue. Earthy, it finishes awash in vanilla-tinged oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Supple and fruity, this is bright with red fruits given a lift with spice. The wine is all about fruit with acidity to add a fresher character. Tannins are already integrating meaning the wine will be ready soon. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a ripe, perfumed blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sauvignon Gris. It is smooth and creamy in texture, with rich apricot and pear flavors. Spice comes from five months wood aging. It is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A Portuguese classic, this fresh and fruity wine comes from a small zone in the heart of the Lisboa region. It is citrus flavored with delicious lime and pear flavors, fine acidity and a bright, zesty aftertaste. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a fruity, full wine that is dominated by Arinto, giving fresh, lemon and apricot flavors. It is crisp, lightly textured and offers a bright tang of zest and acidity on the finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a touch of sweetness around fruit flavors of apple, pear and melon. This has a forward, easy-drinking style, and that hint of honey finishes out with a streak of caramel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A 100% varietal wine, this is both soft and dense, herbal and restrained in cranberry and red currant. Dry and dusty, the body is medium to full bodied, and the finish medium-long. Enjoy now.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "This has pleasant oak aromas suggesting buttered toast, and fairly rich, ripe fruit flavors that resemble peach, pear and a touch of fig. The texture is smooth, almost creamy, the body is medium and the flavors stay fresh through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Strongly briny and raw on the nose, with an insistent aroma of tomato sauce, this cool-region Pinot is austere at first, then dry, raw and snappy by the midpalate. Racy red plum, currant and spice flavors finish dry, with blazing acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This vibrant sparkler opens with aromas of ripe red berry and spice. Made from Frappato, the lively palate doles out wild strawberries, crushed cherries and just a hint of white pepper alongside firm acidity and persistent bubbles.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Gritty, tarry plum and raspberry aromas are firm and good. This feels wide, fleshy and tomatoey. Plum, raspberry and currant flavors turn more oaky and toasty as they open, while the finish is lightly herbal and peppery in flavor, with zesty acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "One of many excellent values to be found among the 2012 Southern Rhône wines, this is supple in style, with ripe cherry and chocolate accented by vanilla and sandalwood. Drink now–2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Violet and red cherry aromas are followed by flavors of tart cherry, mesquite smoke and pepper on the palate. A little angular but overall nicely rounded by Syrah, this Xinomavro blend is a good cohort to meats and cheese.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Savory, slightly saucy aromas of plum, berry, tomato and leather come with a hint of oak. This is a bit choppy and tannic, with savory, roasted flavors of tomato, plum, currant and spice. A touch of saltiness and raw-oak flavor rise up on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is rich and structured while also approachable. It is meant for drinking young with its ripe, black currant and plum skin flavors, stalky acidity and great depth of flavor. Drink from early 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Lompoc-based winery blends 59% Grenache Blanc, 25% Marsanne, 15% Roussanne and 1% Viognier from four vineyards to make this delicate jasmine- and coconut-laced bottling. The palate exhibits decent tension and a sizzle of fresh acidity, delivering bright lemon and pear flesh flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While the nose of this Viennese field blend is shy, the palate brims with fruit: zesty citrus, grapefruit pith and green and yellow apple. Streamlined and textured with a moreish, pervasive and brightening freshness, it tingles with herbal spice on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dry yeasty aromas control the nose on this moderately sophisticated rosé that's made entirely from Trepat. In the mouth, this is solid but not thick. Dry peach and nectarine flavors are clean and finish with just enough girth to chew on.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With a long skin maceration to give plenty of flavor, this wine has fine ripe red-berry fruitiness as well as a rich texture. It is smooth although there is a touch of minerality from the schist soil. La Londe, a new appellation, is worth watching. Perfumed and fruity, the wine is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With its proportion of Mourvèdre in the blend, this is a ripe and perfumed wine. It has a rich sumptuous feel with ripe strawberry and crisper red currants. The wine is generous and ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cassis and elderberry scents pair perfectly with tobacco and loamy dust aromas in this serious blend of 32% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Franc, 6% Petit Verdot and 6% Malbec. Tobacco accents the black fruit on the palate as well, with dill, anise and charcoal touches. It's firmly structured and bone dry.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Organic Cabernet Sauvignon and Tannat give this wine both its great fruit and its structure. It is a densely tannic wine with a solid core that then bursts out with black-currant and black-plum fruits. Intense acidity partners the concentrated fruit. Drink from 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a young obviously wood-aged wine with a strongly toasty bitter character. Happily, the fruit is as concentrated as the wood with blackberry and black-plum flavors that will come through strongly. It is going to be a serious and impressive wine, firmly structured and rich. Drink from 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With vineyards located in the small range of mountains known as the Alpilles (little Alps), this wine comes from a beautiful organic estate. The wine, with its full range of Provence grapes in the blend, is packed with red fruits. It has a tight texture that points up the fruitiness. Drink this finely structured wine now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wood smoke and black pepper aromas start this full-bodied wine out with a bang. Lively, spicy blackberry and black cherry flavors contribute richness on the palate, accented with toasty, savory, meaty overtones. Add its moderate tannins, and the overall effect is a generous, complex and interesting wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mild comfortable aromas of burnt orange and spiced pumpkin lead to a tight, focused palate of moderate weight. Dry melon and peach aromas are on the money, while this finishes clean as polished glass, with a touch of spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe grapy aromas are more chunky than mammoth. Saturated and muscular on the palate, this tastes of roasted salty blackberry, while the finish is full and meaty in both flavor and texture. Drink this stout full-bodied Malbec through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Oaky aromas of maple, blackberry and chimney grit set up a raw tannic palate. This tastes toasty and oaky, but with enough black-fruit flavor to support all that wood. Mild herb and spice flavors mix with tea and berry notes on the finish of this off-vintage Tempranillo. Drink through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe blackberry and cassis aromas are toasty at first, then charred as this breathes. A big grabby palate is muscled up but welcoming. Toasty blackberry and cassis flavors remain charred on a loaded lengthy finish. This is Malbec and Petit Verdot fermented and aged together. Drink through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a five-acre benchland vineyard, this elegant red is sharp with acidity and a full-sized tannic grip that softens in the glass. Oak-derived flavors blanket its black cherry fruit, with distinct leather and black pepper accents.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Joseph Jewell's 2014s from remote Humboldt County are dazzling. The color off this wine is on the light side, and so are the raspberry, tea leaf and cinnamon flavors, but they make for a pleasant, harmonious combination. Medium body, vibrant acidity and firm but light tannins add to its appetizing character.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from organic grapes, this estate wine from the high-altitude property is crisp and tightly fruity. It boasts great acidity and refreshingly bright red-currant fruitiness. This is ready now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a selected parcel in the estate, this organically grown wine is a ripe blend of Cinsault and Grenache. It is crisp and tight with minerality and zesty orange flavors. Dry and lightly structured, it is a fine food-style rosé. Drink from late 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A very pale wine—it's just barely pink. With Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, it has a fine structured character that gives the wine weight. There are also refreshingly attractive red-berry fruits and a ripe aftertaste. Drink this complex wine from late 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the ripest wine in the Béatrice range. With generous red fruits and balanced acidity it has weight and richness alongside the crisp, tangy fruitiness. This is a textured wine with spice and pepper flavors to add complexity to the fruit. Drink the wine from late 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The origins of this estate go back to the 13th century when it was the property of the Knights Templar. The large 400-acre vineyard has produced this fine rich wine, full of ripe red fruits and with a bright herbal edge. It is bone dry, crisp and ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas are locked up at present, with notes of barrel spice, clove, herb and brooding dark fruit. The fruit and barrel flavors are concentrated and tightly wound. The oak is predominant at present. Give it some time in the cellar to strut its stuff. Best after 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "For this medium-sweet wine, the Grassa family has chosen one of the Southwest's great grape varieties. The Gros Manseng easily makes this style: fruity and with a fine balance between sweetness and crisp acidity. This is a young wine, named after the singing thrush (grive) in the vines. It's still developing and will be better from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is among the best deals out of Santa Barbara County each vintage. A blend of 47% Grenache, 26% Mourvèdre, 15% Cinsault and 12% Counoise, it offers rose petal, anise, lilac and lavender on the nose. There's an elegant lightness on the palate, where vibrant wild raspberry, red plum and potpourri spice flavors shine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A restrained hint of peach plays on the nose of this wine. The palate comes in with a little spritz and lots of savory, yeasty spice. White pepper accents lemon and pear peel flavors on the streamlined palate. The finish is lemony and fresh.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This fresh, crunchy red shows ripe but balanced cherry notes. The nose is still restrained, but the palate delivers juicy, enlivening freshness with a pleasant grip. A fresh finish makes it very moreish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A chocolaty frame wraps around the tightly wound cherry-fruit core. There are delicious seams of coffee, vanilla and caramel, along with notes of tea and tobacco. It's fully accessible and intriguingly complex.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This elegant wine combines subtle nutmeg and cardamom aromas with crisp apple, bosc pear and mild vanilla-bean flavors. Its firm texture and lingering finish bring everything into balance, with no single element overpowering the others, making it a pleasure to sip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine's restrained nose just hints at blueberry and cinnamon. The palate comes in with freshness, verve and balance. Crunchy red cherry fruit is at the core, balanced by freshness and a taut structure. An elegant, ripe, medium-bodied red.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Evoking green grape, peach, honeysuckle and ripe melon, this Muscat's aromatic profile is as enticing as ever, all wrapped in a slender, absolutely dry and light-footed package. Full of rich flavor without the attendant weight, it embodies the scent and joy of summer and finishes on a refreshing note of zesty lemon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This fresh and fruity wine opens with aromas of lychee, white fragrant flowers, exotic fruit and beeswax. The fresh palate offers pineapple, white peach, melon, lemon peel and Alpine herbs.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "White rose petals and lychee aromas take center stage in this medium-bodied wine. They carry over to the palate alongside ripe exotic fruit and clove. It's slightly sweet with a silky texture and good weight.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The 2012 vintage brings rich fruit flavors to this estate bottling, with a core of cherries and streaks of kale and espresso. The tannins are ripe and sufficient, though the herbal elements may soften a bit with further bottle age.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A classic vinification in tank and barrel has produced a ripe, full-bodied wine. It has ripe cherry and dark plum fruits; layers of wood-aging flavors give a complete, dense and concentrated wine. It will age, drink until 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This unoaked, 100% Grenache rosé is rich in orange, cherry, apricot and vanilla flavors. Crisp in acidity, it has a clean, vibrant mouthfeel. It's lovely to drink now with a wide variety of fare, from fried chicken to Thai food and tuna tartare.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It discloses a refined version of the variety's classic aromas of white roses, lychee and grapefruit, which all carry over to the palate. The juicy fruit is accented with light notes of black pepper, candied ginger and clove that add depth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dusty mineral and dried herb notes lend a savory tone to this elegant semisweet Riesling. The palate is intensely fruity, with ripe nectarine and tangerine flavors. It finishes moderately long, with a wet-stone minerality.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fragrances of apple, pear and citrus carry over to the palate, along with pineapple and banana sensations. It has a fine, persistent perlage and a bone-dry finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A darker, quite savory expression of Black Kite's entire vineyard site in the Deep End of Anderson Valley, this Pinot imparts a touch of cardamom spice and high acidity, with a dryness to the finish that gets a lift from that acid at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very elegant, it opens with refined aromas of rose petals, lychee and a hint of juicy citrus fruit. The full-bodied palate delivers ripe pink grapefruit and steely mineral notes accented with a spicy note of white pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raspberry jam, orange peel and sweet oak flavors mark this Pinot Noir. It's very dry, acidic and tannic, not showing much of interest now, but the complexity suggests limited ageability. Try after 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Structured but elegant, it discloses delicate aromas of Spanish broom and Granny Smith apple. The savory, creamy palate delivers juicy Bartlett pear, citrus, nectarine and melon brightened by crisp acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Loureiro grape is the signature grape of the Lima valley where the Paçao Padreiro is situated. This wine brings out the lime and citrus character of the grape along with its riper orange and peach fruit. It is rich, full and ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A fine, smooth, wood-aged wine that already shows good balance between creamy toast and fresh, citrus and white fruits. It is cut-through with youthful acidity and a crisp structure, promising aging. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A big, ripe, still very young wine with black fruits that are right up front. It's jammy and juicy, with almost as much fruit as tannin. There is some aging potential, with the underlying dryness of the structure, but the wine is mostly about ripe fruitiness. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a mineral, textured wine that has fine tannins and balanced ripe black fruits. It's dry, although with an undertow of richness, acidity and weight. It could age, so wait until 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With attractive mint aromas, this polished wine balances structure and fruit. New wood shows through but it doesn't dominate the black fruits that give weight and ripeness. It shows the typical juiciness of the vintage. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Chewy tannins make this Pinot Noir feel hard in the mouth. On the plus side is a dense core of raspberries and cherries, as well as a rich appliqué of smoky oak. Try aging it until 2017 to let it mellow.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With its honeyed aromas, this is a warm and rich wine. It has some ripe, buttery flavors alongside more fruity apples and pears. It is smoothly textured, feeling ripe and ready to drink by 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With rich tropical fruits and a ripe, opulent feel, this is a full-bodied wine. It has weight, layers of toast and apricot and peach flavors. Soft and round, it could be drunk now, although it would be best to wait until 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe and juicy, this is already an attractive wine. It does have a tannic structure for aging, but the bright red fruits, touches of cherry and layers of acidity are the stand outs. So drink this wine from 2015 or keep until 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a ripe wine, full of apple and apricot fruit with a strong citrus line. A touch of minerality adds tangy texture and gives this rich wine plenty of life and freshness. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Brick dust, tomato paste, oregano and basil aromas control the nose on this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend. The palate is narrow in feel, while flavors of roasted berry, vanilla, mocha and burnt caramel finish creamy and warm, with good texture and modest complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Saline, lime, grass, bell pepper and green bean aromas swirl around the bouquet on this fresh, coastal SB. This feels round yet crisp, with modest acidic cut and flavors or orange, passion fruit and minerals. Finishing flavors are similar, with a hint of green herb.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ed Sbragia brings his penchant for huge wines to Chardonnay. This '10 is strong and intense in tropical fruits, peaches, buttered toast and vanilla, and while it's balanced and flashy, it will dominate almost any food you pair it with.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "For a (relatively) mass production Oregon Pinot, this offers excellent flavors and comparatively good value. A seductive nose leads into a plush palate mixing berries, cola, clean earth and rock. It's textural and balanced, with enough complexity to keep you coming back to the glass.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tough tannins and mouthwatering acidity frame the deeply intense black currant flavors of this dry, young Malbec. It seems perfectly designed for pairing with steak. Drink now–2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It opens with aromas of beeswax, acacia flower and lightly toasted oak. The smooth, structured palate offers lemon drop, white peach, papaya and a subtle note of vanilla and spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from the Turbiana grape, this dessert wine conveys aromas of apricot, mineral, toasted breadcrumbs and vanilla. The rich palate delivers ripe but restrained yellow peach, honey, roasted almond, and candied ginger alongside fresh acidity that gives this a clean finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine shows more character and finesse than most other Italian whites in this price range. Subtle aromas of apples, peach and mineral carry over to the bright, savory palate along with citrus notes and crisp acidity. It has nice length and leaves the mouth feeling clean and fresh.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is firm and structured, with complex tannins and dark black-fruit flavors. Under the tannins, juicy fruit with considerable acidity gives signs of great potential. The aftertaste again comes back to the structure. Drink from 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Much care goes into this blend, which was fermented both in neutral wood and in stainless steel. Just 10% went through malolactic. It's a light, clean, well-defined effort, offering accents of salad greens, celery and lemon verbena around crisp apple fruit flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Vines from high up in the vineyard produce this cool, fresh wine. It has bright acidity along with intense grapefruit and lemon fruits. The wine is tangy with a strong texture. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Citrus, Mediterranean herb and cut grass aromas lead the way. The crisp palate offers Bartlett pear, unripe apricot and grapefruit alongside tangy acidity. A saline note backs up the succulent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Grapefruit, lemon and star anise aromas lead this refined but friendly wine. On the palate, lush, rounded flavors of melon and tropical fruit are supported by brisk acidity. Great combination with richer poultry or pork dishes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe yellow apple and yellow plum notes make for an appetizing nose. The palate is equally fresh and full fruited, sporting sassy, defining freshness that makes it mouthwatering and appetizing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of Spanish broom, cherry blossom and a hint of woodland berry lead the way on this delicately hued rosato. Made with Nerello Mascalese, the vibrant palate doles out ripe red cherry, crushed strawberry, nectarine zest and a mineral note. A touch of white almond closes the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Powerful fruit aromas and flavors send this full-bodied wine into the stratosphere of ripeness without interference from oak or too much acidity or any overtly tannic texture. It's all juicy and good in a high-octane style.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Like a well-made café latte, this wine balances the dry and restrained elements against creamy, mocha nuances that round out the texture and bring an almost sweet, jammy taste to the finish. Just substitute rich blackberry for coffee flavors to make the analogy work.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Struck flint and smoke lend shade to exuberant pineapple, mango and citrus flavors in this sprightly, honey-kissed Auslese. It's an approachable but elegant wine invigorated by whiffs of fresh green herbs and a touch of bitter pollen on the finish. A fantastic bargain find.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is powerful enough to serve with wild boar carpaccio, if there is such a thing, or with blue cheese like a Port. The color is unusually dark and opaque, a stark black with a faintly purple rim. It smells spicy and tastes very concentrated, like blackberry jam, wood smoke and black pepper. The texture is almost thick and drenched with fine tannins while the body is quite full as well.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Woody fruits of elderberries and wild blackberries meet with toasted sage and scents of wildfire on this blend of 76% Grenache, 14% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre. The palate blends baked cherries and other cooked dark fruit with oregano, thyme and an array of dried Mediterranean herbs.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A terrific value in sparkling wine, this slightly copper-tinged bubbly features classy aromas of dried thyme, citrus and apple. On the light-bodied palate, there's a hint of creaminess and the merest suggestion of strawberry, although apple and citrus dominate. A great option for summer entertaining.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intricate aromas and spicy, complex flavors make this medium-bodied wine an adventure to drink. It smells like cherries and cloves and wood smoke, tastes nicely ripe but dry, and has an appetizing, tannic grip in the texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy scents of scorched earth, underbrush, licorice and dark berry emerge in the glass. The firm palate offers tastes of black raspberry, sage, toast, oak and espresso alongside assertive tannins that leave a drying finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Snappy cool-coast aromas of wet stones and green fruits are pungent but not over-the-top aggressive. This is friendly on the palate, with moderate acidity. Flavors of green apple, lime and scallion finish mild and clean. Drink during 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This aged 100% Traminer has aromas of yellow peach, canned apricots and caramel. It is soft on entry into the mouth and has flavors of peach pie and caramelized apples.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This high-alcohol, full-bodied wine made from a grape variety known for its very dark juice, is definitely deep in color, generous and ripe in flavor, firm and tannic in texture but not at all harsh. It gushes with blackberry, boysenberry and cranberry flavors, coats the mouth with fine tannins and lingers on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This luminous white offers delicate scents suggesting crushed rock, pear and a whiff of botanical herb. The taut, vibrant palate recalls Granny Smith apple, nectarine and mineral set against a backbone of firm acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of petrol and tropical fruits are pithy and a touch bitter, but are clearly those of Riesling. A crisp, acid-ripped palate runs long, with lime, lychee and stony flavors. A tangy, citric finish shows modest pithy bitterness along the way.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dusty aromas blend with cool-climate notes of bell pepper and lime on this racy, green-leaning SB. Flavors of wet stones, lime and salt are crisp, while this finishes with a bell-pepper flavor and zesty acidity. This was made for raw oysters or ceviche.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Violets, olallieberries and dark tobacco leaves arise on the nose of this great-deal wine by vineyard manager Erik Mallea. It's relatively easy to sip, without intrusive tannins, offering black cherries, fudge richness and the tang of black plum skins.\n",

      "This wine is tight and well-structured, emphasizing a good, gripping texture and firm tannins while tasty berry flavors lurk beneath. It's not something to sip at a party, but a gutsy dinner wine to pour with osso buco or mushroom risotto.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offers aromas suggesting mature apple, citrus, hazelnut and a whiff of dried herb. The rich, full-bodied palate doles out candied nectarine zest and ripe pear while a mineral note lifts the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of hazelnut nut, smoke and dried chamomile flower slowly come together. On the racy palate, a mineral vein underscores yellow apple, lime and dried sage while a bitter almond note wraps up the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With aromas and flavors like wild berries and black pepper, this full-bodied wine offers plenty of good fruitiness but also savory touches that lend complexity. Its smooth texture and easy drinkability make it a pleasure to sip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fried banana, struck match, smoked mozzarella and seared lemon show on the nose of this bottling from a winery along the mountaintop road that cuts through the appellation. Citrus, apple and smoked stone-fruit flavors trend toward vanilla on the long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A well-balanced and focused wine, this is not big in structure but has tasty fruit flavors, a good crisp mouthfeel and moderate tannins for grip. The wine won't soon get tiring, and will make a good, versatile pairing with food.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While showing a bit tight and closed off, this brisk off-dry Riesling features fresh, tart peach and lemon flavors. It's refreshingly mineral with a honed, steely finish that lingers.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pure varietal and estate grown, this opens with pretty fruit flavors of cherry and red plum. Aging in one-quarter new French oak adds a pleasing toasty note, along with a hint of dark chocolate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pineapple, grapefruit, and apricot show brightly on the nose and palate. Simultaneously refreshing and sophisticated on the palate, this wine has a crisp, lingering finish laced with flavors of almond blossom.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the product of two childhood friends, both of whom grew up in the wine business in Napa Valley. Taken, if this wine is any indication, aims to offer great Napa Valley wine at affordable prices. This Cabernet-Merlot blend is smooth in juicy red and blue fruit and completely silky tannins, completely satisfying for all kinds of scenarios.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright and fragrant, this luminous wine opens with aromas of rose, violet and crushed raspberry. The juicy palate delivers mouthfuls of sour cherry and cinnamon alongside fresh acidity and supple tannins that give a silky texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Red apple aromas form the core with pear and yellow melon on the fringes of this stainless steel Chardonnay from Lompoc's Kenneth “Joey” Gummere. The tart green apple and pear skin acidity is expected, but it retains a full body—a prime example of a stainless Chard that's sleek but not overly austere.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A wonderfully aromatic wine that's bone dry, fresh and textured. A steely edge gives a mineral, tight character that emphasizes the youth of the wine. With a dominance of orange and lemon zest, plus juicy acidity, the wine does need a year or two; drink after 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot combine harmoniously in this concentrated, structured and brooding red wine. It's wrapped in black fruit, black tea and herb tones, with a little clove flirting above the fray. The tannins are dry.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Invigorating and frothy, this opens with aromas of woodland berries and violets. The savory palate offers mouthfuls of wild cherry, strawberry and clove alongside bright acidity and small, persistent bubbles. Chill this down for a crisp and refreshing summer red.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark black in color and intensity, Buckeye is from a coolish high-elevation site on Howell Mountain that often is the winery's last pick. In 2011 the fruit must have held on for a while, the components herbal and forest-y, the finish suggestive of leather.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hand-sorting and 18 months of aging is the key here. This 80% Merlot blend with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc offers a generously proportioned balance of tannins and black fruits. It has full-bodied character, packed with berry fruits and rich acidity. With all these elements, it will develop well. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Structured and fruity, this 25-acre vineyard of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc has produced a blend that is solid and with a good future. It has black fruits and firm tannins along with well-judged wood aging (six to eight months). It is ripe, with attractive juicy flavors and spice. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The deep, brooding nose blends dark purple fruit with black licorice and Chinese black pepper sauce. Sage bark and anise contribute herbal tones to the palate—likely thanks to the inclusion of 14% Merlot and 11% Cabernet Franc—and blackberries rule the fruit profile.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a solid wine with herbal, minty aromas and an opulent structure. Showing power and complexity, the rich body is full of juicy blackberry notes, with striations of acidity. Drink this powerful wine after 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From young vines, this wine offers up pretty scents of rose petals and lightly peppery strawberries. Just 5% Mourvèdre was included, but its presence brings a dash of extra spice and herb.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sour fruits, tobacco pipe resin and toasted coconut combine for a funky but pleasing nose on this blend from Core Wine Co. The flavors are leathery with plum jam, and vibrant acidity runs from front to back.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Produced in the Vallée Noble sub-region in Soultzmatt, this is ripe and powerfully rich. It is strongly perfumed, full of white fruit and very floral in character. A thread of minerality runs through this still-young wine giving structure. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is pure Cabernet Sauvignon from the Stillwater vineyard, ripe and loaded with dark fruits. There's a strong element of char, smoke and roasted espresso running through the finish. Tannins are silky, but the flavors are right on the edge of burnt. Drink this with a juicy, charcoal-grilled steak and it will hit the bulls-eye.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas produces this label with her father and winemaker Joey Tensley, whose handiwork unleashes aromas of white pepper, black cherry, a cornucopia of dark berries and earthy minerality. Bright acidity on the palate partners with blackberry soda flavors, quite racy for the variety.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe, soft and very drinkable, this has a generous structure that cushions the tannins with rounded black fruits. The acidity and the warm, generous character of the 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc blend net a fine representation of the fruity 2012s. This is Bordeaux consultant Stéphane Derenoncourt's home turf. Wooden fermenters and 16 months in barrel (40% new) necessitate time, so drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While it is closed and tough at present, this is definitely a wine with a future. The hand-harvested 65% Merlot and 35% Cabernet Franc blend has both firm tannins and the promise of ripe fruits, black berries and a rich, opulent character. Spice and new wood (one-third new French oak) are balanced by the fruits and they are brought together by the acidity at the end. Sophie Lavaud, who has owned the 13-acre estate since 2010, is in the process of getting organic certification.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Only two acres of Syrah are planted at the estate vineyard, which is a shame, as this makes you wish for much more. Just in its 4th leaf, the vines are already producing fruit with clear and complex varietal character. Bacon fat, smoke, licorice and a floral lift all come through on the nose. These flavors follow to a medium-bodied palate with proportionate structure and some persistence through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Whole berry fermented and aged seven months in neutral oak, it shows appealing notes of dried herbs, raspberry and cherry. The palate is fruit focused with a abundant sweet raspberry flavors that linger on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the rocky Stagecoach Vineyard atop Atlas Peak, this Cabernet is hearty in tannins and built to age through 2020, the dense black berry and cherry fruit flavors needing time to mature. For now, the wine's character is all savory and leathery, with tight tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Delicate sprays of cherry blossom and raspberry waft from nose to finish on this salmon-pink blend of traditional Champagne grape varieties. Zesty lemonade acidity is lively on the palate, leading to a long, softly foamed finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright bubblegum, chilled watermelon and strawberry-and-cream aromas weave into a beautiful bouquet on this salmon-colored wine. The flavors are warm and dry but really flavorful, with red apples and papaya fruit perked up with a dash of lime juice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full-bodied and flavorful, this four vineyard cuvée may be characterized as buttered popcorn meets golden apple and toasted nuts. You can ride with that posse all the way through the medium-length, well-balanced and clean finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intensely perfumed, this wine is also structured and fresh. Combining these elements gives a dense wine, firmly textured and with a dry core. Acidity gives the natural richness lift. It's meant for aging, drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an aromatic dazzler, with notes of herb, apricot, orange peel and dried flowers. It drinks off dry, with rich, mineral stone-fruit flavors and balanced acidity. Pair with curried shrimp.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A year in the barrel has given this powerful wine structured, yet polished tannins. While still young, it is powered by ripe red berry notes and driving juicy acidity. It's a wine for further aging, so drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Though reserved in the nose, this wine from a vineyard to the west of the Sta. Rita Hills already presents a bit of aromatic age, with honey, almond and dried apricot. It's lean, bright and flinty once sipped, with gravel, tangerine pith and chamomile, proving to be a refreshing sipper that never tires. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "One of the rare vineyards which can produce Grand Cru Sylvaner, Zotzenberg's chalk soil gives a mineral while juicy and fresh wine. The lightest hint of spice gives the wine some weight, and the ripe, fruity apples and creamed pear are already delicious. Not for aging.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of black cherry and a hint of height-of-summer farmstead prep the palate for flavors of blackberry, black cherry, roasted meat, sage, and bell pepper. There is a nice combination of fruit and savory flavors, and the persistent finish offers lingering notes of fruits of the wood and roasted meat. Mevushal.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a balanced wine that has attractive citrus flavors, riper peach and pineapple and a light apricot perfume from the Viognier in the blend. It is rich while having plenty of freshness. Drink from late 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mature dark-skinned fruit, aniseed and aromatic herb aromas play in the glass. On the firm palate, fine-grained tannins support bright red cherry, mint, rosemary and toast. Drink after 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of woodland berry, toast, clove and chopped herb emerge in the glass. The palate is still rather closed, eventually giving up raw red berry, coconut, espresso, oak and grilled sage alongside tightly wound, astringent tannins. Give this a few more years to open up. Drink 2018–2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Scents of pressed violet, mature dark-skinned fruit and a balsamic note of camphor slowly take shape. The forward palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and clove alongside brooding, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2018–2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A light mauve in color, this Pinot Noir-based wine shows boisterous plum fruit, macerated strawberries and a hint of clove on the ripe nose, making it more entrée-ready than apéritif-aimed. The palate offers strawberry and bubble-gum notes deftly hidden behind a veil of sour cherry and plum-skin tartness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a classic style of Cabernet that should improve with age. It smells like pencil shavings, tobacco and cedar, and tastes like dark chocolate and black cherry, while feeling very firm on the palate. It has fine-grained tannins, and a lingering dark chocolate and cherry finish. It will be best after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Black olive, boysenberry, graphite and cracked pepper season up a slightly gamy nose on this bottling from a popular Los Alamos vineyard. The flavors are a study of blackness, with peppercorns, asphalt and deep purple fruits that are both dark and tart, all framed by a boisterous acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Shocks of ripe rich yellow peach and pineapple revitalize the palate of this animated off-dry Riesling. Simultaneously bracing and sun-drenched, it's a straightforward yet delectably juicy treat. Enjoy now while young.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A tight nose of blackberry and mint smooths the way for flavors of blackberry and pencil lead with a light dose of mint. There is a nice balance of acidity and tannins, with fruit lingering on the palate after the soft finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tropical with notes of gingerbread and vanilla, this wine tastes full bodied despite its medium level of alcohol. It offers a reduced note on the finish, anchored otherwise in sweet toffee.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crisp minerally aromas of cherry and blackberry come with toasty spicy accents. This is a tightly built full-bodied Cab with lightly herbal, moderately oaky and saucy flavors of berry and plum. A dry, spicy finish provides for a strong ending.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Strong blackberry aromas come with hints of wood smoke, graphite and minerality. On the palate, it is high in acidity and a touch scouring, but also fresh and lively. Common blackberry and toasty oak flavors end fresh and crisp, but short.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Forward and full-bodied, this opens with aromas of mature dark fruit, grilled herb, toast, spirits and a balsamic note. On the warm palate, oak and licorice provide the backdrop to black cherry marinated in spirits alongside firm tannins. The heat of alcohol closes the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh scents of rose petal, iris, aromatic herb and woodland berry float out of the glass. The palate offers raw red cherry, anise and dried sage alongside bracing tannins and nervous acidity. Drink 2018–2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Slightly muted aromatically and on the palate, this sports clean and fresh cherry fruit, with a pleasing suggestion of minerality. The midpalate feels a bit hollow.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Baking spice, dried flower, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of coconut lead the nose on this straightforward Barolo. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, toast and vanilla alongside firm, tightly knit tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rather reserved in aromas for a dessert wine, this allows blackberry, black pepper and mineral notes to emerge with time. The palate is lightly sweet, with ripe blackberry and blueberry-jam flavors, made interesting with a pencil-lead minerality throughout.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sun-ripened mango and pineapple flavors lend a lavish, tropical feel to this off-dry Riesling. At the same time, there's a resolute core of acidity that gives it balance and grace. It's concentrated and fruity but maintains vitality and length.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Brisk and bright, this delicately framed Pinot Noir offers both elegance and thirst-quenching quaffability. It's fresh and primary, bursting of raspberry and blossom, but finishes suprisingly long with a murmur of feathery tannin. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Papaya and stone-fruit aromas are fleshy and a touch green and grassy, giving way to dustiness upon airing. This feels spritzy and good, with a full complement of golden apple, white grape and green plum flavors. Solid, stony and minerally on the finish, with a hint of tropical fruit flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a lot of slate minerality on the nose of this bottling, alongside bright and fresh boysenberry fruit and a pine-needle character. The palate is tart with plum skin and grippy tannins, well balanced and also showing just the right amount of barnyard funk.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh cherry and plum aromas are a bit scratchy but alert. This feels firm, with bright acidity creating a raw sense on the palate. Plum, berry and a pinch of saltiness make for an authentic flavor profile, while this finishes long and steady. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This linear red offers savory fruit flavors of ripe wild cherry, juicy strawberry, toast, white pepper and a hint of grilled herb. Fine-grained, drying tannins provide support. Drink after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoked beef, tart and tangy boysenberry jelly, black rocks and a cigar-box scent power the nose of this wine from an award-winning vineyard. The palate offers ample juicy tang along with chewy tannins, with dark chocolate, black cherry, and black olive enlivening the mouth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offer aromas of plum jam, Oriental spice, underbrush and a whiff of blue flower. The lively, approachable palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry, white pepper and clove alongside vibrant acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Named after a trail in the Grand Canyon, this Napa-made bottling shows Japanese pear and cracked vanilla candy on a complex nose. It offers ample amounts of minerality, from slate to chalk, on the palate, followed by smoked stone fruit in the middle and pencil-lead elements toward the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rubbery, earthy aromas of berry fruits, plum and mushroom are solid but nondescript. This feels grabby and pinchy, with herbal, leafy, salty flavors that end with loamy plum and prune notes. Overall, this is big and forceful. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rose, violet, wild berry and menthol aromas unfold in the glass. The bracing palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and clove alongside assertive, close-grained tannins that leave a mouth-puckering finish. Drink after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The old vines here do give some concentration. More importantly, they give a great swathe of ripe fruit that is so crisp and refreshing. Lemon and the lightest texture are lifted by intense acidity and a lively, fresh aftertaste. This wine is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Coconut and golden apple, hazelnut and pastry crust notes mark the nose. Light to medium in body, the palate feels taut and linear, with a slightly raspy bead. It's aged for 22 months in barrels prior to undergoing secondary fermentation.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is soft, a gentle meander through the flavors of Sauvignon Blanc without any shocks. It has an attractive, rounded texture, with shots of acidity that complement the apple skin and pear flavors. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bitter cherries and a dry core are the two components of this wine. Young, cool fruit comes through the edgy tannic structure. It is still a few months away from maturity, so wait until 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crusty and showing hard spice notes, this opens with staunch aromas. A narrow, pinching palate offers herbal, green-leaning flavors of currant and briary berry. Oak-based chocolate and herbal flavors finish long and strong.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Cabernet Sauvignon grape really comes through on this rosé from Paso Robles pioneer Justin. There is strawberry shortcake at first, but the Cab's capacin-led aromas of green bell pepper are prominent. The pepper carries through to the palate, in a very intriguing, tasty way, offering balance between berry fruit and green bitterness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light and bone-dry, this is crisp, tight and full of lemon and green apple flavors. It's fruity, textured and ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a rich and soft Sauvignon, full of ripe fruits that are heading in a tropical direction. Acidity cuts easily through the yellow fruit flavors and hint of herbaceousness. It's ready to drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of coconut, vanilla and toasted oak carry over to the palate alongside fig, espresso and astringent tannins. It's already evolved and lacks vibrancy and fruit richness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with aromas of underbrush, leather, oak and crushed black cherry. The palate shows predominantly oak sensations including coffee, vanilla and espresso alongside notes of prune, but it lacks fruit richness. Astringent tannins leave the mouth feeling dried out.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In this lemon-scented wine, flavors range easily from herbaceous to pears with a touch of grapefruit thrown in. It's an attractive, ready-to-drink, fruity wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plummy, soft and supple, this 100% Merlot dances in bright black cherry fruit and vanilla. Juicy on the palate and food-friendly, it finishes dusty and fast.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is searingly tart, with more lemon juice than pear fruit, and suggestions of unripe pineapple. On the plus side, it's bright, vivid and strongly acidic.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A bold white wine, it smells and tastes like grapefruit, canteloupe and very crisp apples. It has a fresh, acidic texture that cleans the palate and makes the mouth water, but wraps in enough richness for good balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mushroom, tobacco, leather and red berry aromas lead the nose. The palate is still closed, revealing game, barnyard and bitter, green tannins but not a lot of fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas suggest porcini mushroom, espresso and oak. The oak-driven palate offers up roasted coffee bean, vanilla, oak extract, coconut and vanilla alongside astringent wood tannins that leave the mouth feeling dried out. The lack of fruit richness gives it a raw quality.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Graham cracker and lemon aromas weave into the brioche and porcini undertones. Graceful in weight, this bears a frothy bead that lends the palate tension. Aged on lees for 36 months.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of underbrush, espresso and toasted oak carry over to the palate along with raw red berry. But there's not enough fruit richness to stand up to the astringent tannins and racy acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lovely and aromatic, it's made in large enough quantities to be easily found. Lemon curd and orange blossom pop out first, followed by a soft, minerally midpalate and an intense finish of citrus. A good white to stock up on for a myriad of occasions.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Apple aromas and flavors characterize this medium-bodied wine. It tastes concentrated, focused, bracing and fresh. The texture is lean and crisp, with enough body to add some richness on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Almost like a salad in your glass, this fresh-tasting, dry white wine smells like sugar snap peas and just-picked greens. It tastes snappy and crisp with parsley and thyme flavors, and has a refreshing texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Funky aromas of barnyard eventually burn off to reveal game, animal, rubber, earth and leather. The palate displays porcini mushroom with raw cherry, prune, nutmeg and dried sage. There's not much complexity and it's not an ager so enjoy over the next few years.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bright Arneis boasts sensations of tart green apple, white peach and nectarine accented with a note of mineral. Fresh acidity gives it a clean, refreshing finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With its honeyed aroma, and off-dry palate, this is a ripe and ready-to-drink wine. A touch of acidity balances the rich peach and mango fruits, giving a wine that's delicious as an apéritif.\n",

      "It has a vivid ruby color, cherry and raspberry aromas and flavors, and good balance. It's not too fat, but medium bodied, with firm tannins that help frame the ripe fruit. It adds up to an elegant style.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Brambly soft vanilla marks this wine that's otherwise bright in blueberry fruit and zesty acidity. Medium in weight, it has an abbreviated finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Typical for basic Rioja, this is violet in color, with fresh plum and red berry aromas. The palate comes across kind of hard, tight and candied, with sweet berry fruit flavors that turn bitter on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plum and red-berry aromas are clean and fresh. This skips along on the palate, while flavors of wild berry and plum are a touch raw in character and feel. A rubbery finish is fresh and turns mildly bitter once the fruit fades.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a spicy cinnamon character to this wine that's otherwise flush in blackberry and chest-pounding ripe fruit and oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fruity and fresh, this is Sauvignon Blanc at its most attractive. It shows a touch of minerality, but the citrus and crisp apple flavors dominate. With its light touch, it will make a fine apéritif wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Neutral aromas and a mouthfeel with modest lemony acidity set up pithy citrus flavors and notes of green melon and lychee. The finish on this tropical-tasting wine is creamy and a bit heavy, with lime and green banana flavors. Drink right away.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ponzi is promoting a multi-clone winemaking approach they label “Clonal Massale.” This single vineyard example co-ferments five Dijon and 22 heritage clones of Pinot Noir—the most extensive in the country, according to the winery. Dark and lengthy, it's a sexy, complex yet subtle wine, with blackberry and black cherry fruit, a touch of soy and ample Asian spices.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a vineyard along the Laguna Ridge near Green Valley, this wine shines in spicy black cherry, clove and moderate acidity. Full-bodied and juicy, it's balanced and velvety-smooth—a ripe, bold take on the variety that shows surprising elegance and length.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose merely hints at tropical riches. The stony palate also holds tightly onto its fruit: it is only zesty citrus that can be divined amidst all the stone. Bright lemon shines above what seems a deep dark core of rocky earth. There is real drive and real energy in that bright, lemony vein that runs right through this dry, serious and almost brooding wine. The finish adds a touch of a more mellow apple note that persists throughout the long finish. Wait for this. Drink 2020–2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Just a touch of dried pear and chamomile tisane appear on the shy nose which needs air to open. The palate already has that balm-like concentration of mature Riesling which is joined by a vein of wonderful lemon-zest freshness. Despite the absolute dryness of the palate there is ample, generous and deep-seated fruit: pear, apple and gorgeous tangerine. The finish is clean-cut and resonant. Drink now–2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It's nice to see the quality of this wine reach new heights, as it's still relatively affordable within the Henschke context. The blend includes Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. The 2013 shows a slightly austere side, an aristocratic reserve, but the flavors are classic. Pencil shavings, mint, cassis and cigar box finish with great drive, length and dusty tannins. Drink 2023–2035.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A classic blend of Cabernet and Shiraz, this is cedary and complex upon opening, easily mixing cassis, plum and blackberry with vanilla and baking spices. On the palate, it's dense and concentrated yet slightly reserved, suggesting rather than screaming its potential. A long, mocha-tinged finish wraps things up, combining dusty tannins with mouthwatering acids. Drink 2020–2030+.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Produced by the winemaking team of Léoville las Cases, this wine comes from a separate part of the estate. The wine, with its dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon, is dense with tannins as well as dark fruit. It is firm, powerful and a very fine wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lifted heady notes of Damask rose rise from the glass alongside lemony tang. The palate brims with the same rose petal notes but also holds plenty of spice: sandalwood and ginger, white pepper and the merest touch of vanilla. The palate is concentrated and rounded with gentle sweetness, countered by fresh lemon acidity. The persistence of flavors on the palate is incredible. Serve this either with fruity spicy Asian fare or runny, soft and very ripe cheeses.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The unmistakable yet subtle notes of rose water appear as though they were drizzled over ripe juicy peach flesh. The palate boosts these generous fruit flavors with soft and measured residual sweetness. The medium-dry body is gentle, supple, fluid and generous but punctuated with sprightly, aromatic citrus to strike a harmonious balance. The finish is subtle, clean and perfumed with rose petals. Drink now through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sourced from the estate's Paderewski and Catapult vineyards, this blend of 32% Syrah, 25% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre, 10% Tempranillo and 8% Zinfandel bursts with blackberry, baking spice, violet and Concord grape aromas. Framed by firm but ready tannins, the palate shows blackberry, cola, white pepper and dried lavender flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "One of the first producers to work with Bucher Vineyard fruit, this shows familiarity and comfort in its ability to coax black cherry, pomegranate and allspice flavors, wrapping them in a voluptuous mouthfeel. Full-bodied and lushly layered, it's lengthy with a touch of smoke.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is from the Riddle Ranch above Occidental, a cool, coastal village strongly influenced by the Pacific Ocean. Reduced on the nose, it offers brightly woven raspberry and strawberry flavors, rounded by sizable, firm tannins and a midpalate girth that finds relief in rose petal and zesty allspice notes on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A lovely hue, this is scented with crushed rose petals and raspberries. It's tart, with zippy acidity, and a terrific midpalate lift. The finish resonates with a coating of café crême.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "At once powerful and graceful, this delivers alluring aromas and flavors of ripe black cherry, raspberry compote, grilled herb, licorice and an intriguing tarry note. Fresh acidity and firm, velvety tannins provide balance and structure, while a hint of pipe tobacco closes the lingering finish. Drink 2020–2032.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intense baked plum and black cherry aromas meet with vanilla, caramel and sagebrush on the nose of this bottling from one of the appellation's most coveted vineyards. The tangy, energetic and grippy palate offers crushed cranberry flavors, more black plum, gingerbread and exotic Indian spice on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The second release of this Oregon Pinot project from Walla Walla's Jon Meuret (Maison Bleue) is irresistible. A three-clone blend from a top Columbia Gorge vineyard, it's explosively aromatic, with a strong whiff of pipe tobacco that Meuret believes is a vineyard marker. Those powerful aromatics push into a dense core of strawberry-cherry fruit, enhanced by oak notes. Delicious now, this has the structure and power to cellar well. Drink now through 2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hints of sultana and cooked quince reach the nose suggesting richness. The palate, however, responds with streamlined freshness, ripe fruit and depth and gives us concentration rather than richness. Tangy citrus zest frames notions of ripe apple and quince while shadows of dried fruit still haunt aromatically. The finish is clean, totally satisfying and dry. This is soaring but hearty stuff.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wild berry, forest floor, chopped herb and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find in this bright, elegant red. The vibrant, medium-bodied palate offers crushed raspberry, red cherry and baking spice flavors, buttressed by taut, polished tannins and fresh acidity. A blast of orange zest further lifts the finish. Drink 2019–2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a big wine in its breadth of flavors and structure. Powerful tannins give hints of the wood aging. The ripe black fruit is given a crisp edge by the acidity that is typical of the vintage. The wine will certainly age well. Drink from 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Another Joe Davis wine that's benefited from patience, this bottling offers more mature character than the same vineyard's 2009. Umami touches of soy, shiitake and leather underscore the cherry and raspberry scents on the nose. It has a grippy texture and a subtly presented range of flavors—from dried anise and Christmas spice to elderberry, cranberry and dried plum skin.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From near Olivet Lane and Pellegrini Vineyard—some of the longest planted sites in the appellation—this red is densely packed with spicy, wild black and red fruit, with a soft underbelly of structure. Earthy mushroom and forest pine give it a savory dimension, through soft, silky waves of texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a fabulous wine, a notch above the three other vineyard-designated Pinots from Black Kite. Black tea, black cherry and herbal aromas blend with focused cherry, rhubarb and cranberry flavors in this full-bodied, complex wine. It's balanced by moderate tannins, giving it both structure and texture, and will drink best after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bottling from the family's smallest vineyard is as special as the three-acre site itself, offering intriguing chive blossom aromas on the nose alongside key lime and pungent honeydew. The palate is laser focused and tense with acidity and structure, showing lime pith, pink grapefruit zest and a chalky minerality reminiscent of crushed sea shell on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Named for Edwards' first grandchild born in this vintage year, this wine is made from fruit sourced from Meredith Estate Vineyard. Velvety smooth and perfumed, it offers piquant pepper and cardamom scents, along with intense rhubarb compote and raspberry flavors. It shows both purpose and quiet power, wrapped in violet and rose.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fruit from this high-profile vineyard builds a velvety silky seductive wine that impresses immediately. It captures the ephemeral elegance of the grape, in a young wine with well-managed phenolics. The strawberry-centric fruit is lightly dusted with cinnamon, from 15 months in 50% new French oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is crisp, floral and pretty in every way. It's classically structured and graceful, with tart apple notes and stony acidity. It allows the fruit to speak softly and subtly, its lower ripeness detracting from niether flavor nor complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is estate-grown and from a single one-acre vineyard, entirely varietal and quite impressive. Soft, integrated tannins and oak are present but behaved, allowing for deeply satisfying layers of black olive, blackberry and bittersweet chocolate to evolve and intermingle on the palate. Big boned, this wine shows balance and complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe blackberry aromas are a touch malty and jammy, with a note of buttered pastry thrown in for good measure. This emphasizes the rich ripe extracted side of Priorat, but balance is not sacrificed. Lush dark toasty black-fruit flavors come with notes of oaky spice and bitter chocolate, while the finish is toasty blackened, deep and chunky. Drink through 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With only 12% new oak and 28% of the fruit coming from the cool Eden Valley, this wine may hold more appeal to lovers of Old World Syrah than any other Torbreck bottling. Pepper, bacon fat and mixed berries mark the nose, while the palate is full, creamy and expansive. The long finish includes enough soft, dusty tannins to suggest cellaring through 2030 as a possibility, although it's delicious now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of barrels selected from several sites, this is a plush, easy-to-love wine. It's shy on the nose at first, just hinting at wild strawberry and herbal aromas. Soft, with a touch of bitter black tea it fades into a slow finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mature black-skinned fruit, menthol, scorched earth and a whiff of forest floor are some of the aromas you'll find on this firmly structured red. The palate offers mature black cherry, black currant and licorice accompanied by a tannic backbone. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of mature cherry, fleshy strawberry and a whiff of dark spice lead the way on this blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot and 5% Canaiolo. On the firm palate, notes of leather, anise, coffee and grilled herb accent the black cherry core. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tan in color and in the early stages of fading, this smells reserved, with aromas of turpentine, popcorn and bread. Rubbery and slightly pinched in feel, this tastes briny, nutty and melony, with plenty of oak in support. A lighlty oaked finish is short in length and complexity. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Chocolate, cherries and baking spices make up the flavors of this layered and tasty wine. The color is dark, the texture is nicely astringent due to assertive tannins, and it conveys a sense of something held in reserve.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plump and round in the mouth, with clean, fresh flavors of pear and pineapple. This year, the Marsanne is better, although the Roussanne should win friends for its charming fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of raspberry jam are a bit stretched out and unusual for a Rioja. In the mouth, this is fresh and fruity, but a bit light on substance. Savory red-fruit flavors end comfortably, with a good texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of red berry, sunbaked earth and crushed blue flower lead the nose. The easy-drinking palate offers mature wild cherry, white pepper and anise alongside polished tannins. It's simple but savory. Drink through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of mature dark-skinned fruit, sunbaked earth, violet and a whiff of espresso lead the nose. The juicy palate doles out ripe black cherry, anise, clove and a hint of coffee alongside round tannins. Enjoy soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of blackcurrant, spice, menthol, espresso and a whiff of toasted oak lead the nose. The round, chewy palate doles out blackberry jam, licorice, ground black pepper and coffee alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, it's evolving quickly so enjoy sooner rather than later.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Espresso, menthol, dried black-skinned fruit and toasted oak aromas come together on this firm red. The hearty palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, powdered sage and coffee alongside assertive tannins. Drink through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with aromas of mature wild cherry and pressed violet while the straightforward, juicy palate offers fleshy black cherry and a note of ground pepper. It's round and ready, with supple tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A mix of just-ripe fruit flavors and savory accents on a medium-bodied frame make this wine intriguing to taste. It starts with seemingly sweet fruity aromas, but then the flavors turn a bit leaner and more complex.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the Malibu-based producer, this bottling has a striking label design that matches with the youthful, vivacious pink wine. The punchy nose blends cherry, lime blossom and pink rose petals with yeasty, sourdough-like aromas, while the palate offers iron, maraschino cherry and lime-wedge flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A lush, medium-bodied wine with an extroverted personality, this starts with aromas like butter, vanilla and toasted baguette, then emphasizes ripe pear and yellow-peach flavors. A soft texture and lingering finish completes the picture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rubbery cherry and berry aromas feed into a forward, chewy palate with raw, spicy flavors of plum offset by oaky vanilla and some bitterness. A fresh, angular finish is braced by snappy acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pure purple fruit and flower aromas hit the nose on this straight-ahead bottling, with plum candy, sour cherry and a touch of soy sauce as well. Strong energy and purple fruit show on the palate, along with violets and blueberries, proving floral and fairly tangy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light and fresh, this is immediately attractive with its green fruits, spice and hints of almonds. There is also a backdrop of minerality to this still-young wine. Aromatic and crisp, it can be drunk now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Briny and dark copper-orange in color, this is a weighty wine, though the alcohol level is low. The tannins and leathery texture of the Syrah shine through, checked by tangy citrus and a hit of white pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a ripe, apple and green stone-fruit flavored wine, with a light texture that nicely supports the fruitiness. The wine is fresh, juicy and with delicious freshness at the end. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a soft, fresh while rounded wine. A gentle texture hints at a more tangy character while pushing the apple and spice flavors forward. Attractive now, the wine is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of vines from different soils, this rich, dense wine has concentration as well as steely, tangy fruits. It is still young and nervy, needing time to open out. Drink this wine from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a blend of seven parcels from the higher slopes of the appellation. They give the wine a cool, fresh character, aromatic and steely. It's a crisp wine, with textured citrus and clean acidity. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a soft, ripe wine, smoothly textured. It has a good balance between the crisp apple and pear flavors and a more mineral texture that gives a bite. It's young, and great to drink now, although it will be even better from late 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe, full bodied and still young, this generous wine is open with its fresh apples and creamy texture that give richness. A touch of toastiness adds to the complexity and potential of the wine. Drink now, although it will be better from the end of 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's bountiful energy on the sizzling nose of this semisweet bottling, with aromas of baking soda, just-cut limes, lemon rinds and a touch of ripe peach. The palate offers apple syrup and peels, tartness from lemon and lime skins, and richness from flavors of orange water and jasmine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aging in big wood barrels has softened the intensity of this wine while leaving the fruitiness intact. It makes for a tangy, mineral-driven wine with a smoky, flinty aftertaste. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The buttered popcorn and woodspice aromas are vibrant. The palate is all about texture and feel, with the spice and stone fruit flavors seeming an accent. The finish lingers. For those looking for a bold, buttery style, look no further.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Vines planted on gravel soil line a terrace above the Cher river. This wine with an intensely herbal character is fresh, crisp and packed with fruit. It has some weight, along with a great lift from the aromatic aftertaste. The wine can be drunk now, although it will be better from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich and full in mouth, this has green and apple fruit flavors that are cut with acidity. The tangy texture gives a contrast and balance to the wine. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Coming from a classic limestone vineyard, this is tense, structured and tight. It is textured, with spice and tangy acidity giving some complexity to the otherwise fruity wine. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is among the best deals out of Santa Barbara County each vintage. A blend of 47% Grenache, 26% Mourvèdre, 15% Cinsault and 12% Counoise, it offers rose petal, anise, lilac and lavender on the nose. There's an elegant lightness on the palate, where vibrant wild raspberry, red plum and potpourri spice flavors shine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A restrained hint of peach plays on the nose of this wine. The palate comes in with a little spritz and lots of savory, yeasty spice. White pepper accents lemon and pear peel flavors on the streamlined palate. The finish is lemony and fresh.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This fresh, crunchy red shows ripe but balanced cherry notes. The nose is still restrained, but the palate delivers juicy, enlivening freshness with a pleasant grip. A fresh finish makes it very moreish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A chocolaty frame wraps around the tightly wound cherry-fruit core. There are delicious seams of coffee, vanilla and caramel, along with notes of tea and tobacco. It's fully accessible and intriguingly complex.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cabernet Sauvignon (37%) and Cabernet Franc (34%) make up the majority of this wine, with the balance Merlot (16%), Malbec (8%) and Petit Verdot. The aromas are quite locked up, with light notes of barrel spice, herb and assorted dark fruit. The palate has light tightly coiled fruit flavors. It needs time to reveal its charms. Best after 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This delightful rosé bursts open with ripe watermelon and strawberry scents and flavors. Highlights suggest candied rose petals, and the flavors continue into cherry soda and hints of pink peppercorn. It's a big bold fruity simply fabulous bottle.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "This cool-climate bottling from the young producer shows tons of florality and spice, from violet and lilac to white pepper and dried herb, underscored by blueberry and tar aromas.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Floral aromas greet the nose before exuberant, juicy dark cherry fruit comes into play in this full-bodied red. Tight-grained tannins lend strength and structure beneath a backdrop of cedar and dried herb flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from 89% Petit Verdot and 11% Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine opens with chalky, dusty tannin and a leathery mouthfeel. It opens slowly in the glass to reveal currant, blackberry and violet flavors. Powerful and elegant, it does the variety justice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a bit fuller and more textural than many Marlborough Sauvignons, which gives it an extra dimension. The aromas show just enough grassy punch to make them pop, while smooth grapefruit flavors build in intensity on the long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Brawny, toasty aromas prop up a sturdy oaky nose with a familiar dark-berry core. This Malbec is tightly wound, with wiry acidity. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, spiced plum, chocolate and cardamom finish earthy and mellow, with a lingering note of exotic spice. Drink through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lime and mineral aromas drive the nose on this fairly full-bodied brut nature from a warm vintage. On the palate, this is balanced, with bubbles absorbed into the wine's fabric. Up-front salty notes are backed by briny apple, nectarine and yeasty flavors, while this is sophisticated and fairly complex on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Organically grown grapes from one of the top Provence estates have produced this light grey-pink colored wine. It is a delicious fruity confection of bright red berries and tangy acidity. There is an attractive touch of minerality to give the wine structure. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a ripe beautifully balanced wine. It has the extra richness and density that comes from a vine produced in the close to Monte Sainte-Victoire. Full of raspberry and orange fruits, the wine has a final tangy herbal edge. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine wears its high alcohol well, appearing light in the glass and delivering loads of chaparral spice, sandalwood, beet, rhubarb and earthy dust scents on the nose. Although light in body, the palate boasts an underlying juiciness, packed with cranberry, thyme and pencil shaving flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Though light in color and body, this wine carries tremendous aromas and flavors, thanks in part to its 5% cofermented Viognier. The nose shows charred beef, crushed elderberry and potpourri scents, while the palate shows tart red currant and cranberry fruit, with smoked beef, white, pepper, rosemary and fennel accents.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Unconventional but outstanding, this wine is an earthy throwback to an earlier era, from its light, brownish color to its dried leaf, rhubarb and wet earth aromas to its lean but complex red cherry, rhubarb and cranberry flavors. Wild yeast and wild bacteria were used for the primary and malolactic fermentations, respectively.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc, 20% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot. The aromas are almost completely shut down at present, with just hints of barrel spice, herb and dark fruit. The fruit flavors are similarly locked up, backed by lightly grainy tannins. There are good things going on but it needs time to reveal itself. Best after 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The winery produces two outstanding Pinots from estate vineyards planted in 1972. This is big and chewy (as the potent alcohol might suggest) and aging in 50% new French oak puts flavors of toasted coconut and caramel around smooth supple cherry fruit. There's a finishing hint of eucalyptus; all in all, it's a terrific value and a truly original take on Pinot Noir.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe yellow plum pervades the nose of this wine. The palate brings more Grüner Veltliner savoriness, with hints of yeast and herb. Light in body and dry in mouthfeel, it refreshes with a lovely herbal citrus tang on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas suggest green apple and melon. This wine drinks dry with a lightly spritzy feel but the flavor concentration seems lacking.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is packed with herbal character, from the aroma through the flavors and the finish. It smells like fresh-cut grass, tastes like snap peas and scallions, and has a bright, almost sharp, citrusy tartness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Yeasty, bready aromas lack the citric kick and minerality that top Rueda whites deliver in spades. The palate is dilute but slightly creamy, while yeasty flavors are low on fruit and finish with a note of gardenia flower.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with scratchy, slightly dirty aromas of blueberry and blackberry. The palate is heavy and jammy, but also somewhat raw and abrasive. Cherry and plum flavors are basic, while an inoffensive finish falls off quickly.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Initially this smells earthy and rubbery, but with airing it shows roasted dark-berry aromas mixed with horsey leather. The palate is full, tannic and scratchy, with black-fruit flavors, pepper, toast and herbal notes. Toast and coffee flavors are found on a hard, tannic finish. Tasted twice with mixed results.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Chunky, raisiny aromas are heavy. In the mouth, this is big, high on acid and a bit shaky in terms of overall balance. Medicinal cherry and plum flavors finish raisiny and plump, with a shot of tomato thrown in.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Concentrated but one-dimensional, this features aromas of stewed fruit, fig, almond, nail polish and coconut, all of which follow through to the warm, monolithic palate. It's already extremely evolved, and lacks vibrancy and complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The reductive scent of rubber meets with deep blackberry on the nose. The palate proves more interesting, with mocha and espresso notes laid over blackberry fruit, all framed in strong tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine from a vineyard 25 miles east of the Monterey Bay shows a slightly reductive character on the nose, with burnt rubber alongside cherry and mint. The palate shows cranberry and pomegranate fruits, with lots of leathery tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas don't seem entirely settled, with notes of char, tire rubber, bacon fat and vanilla accents. The fruit flavors are smoky and sweet, with a slightly astringent feel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Juicy red cherry and raspberry flavors are layered with toast, cinnamon, vanilla and spice in this ornate yet approachable wine. It's sunny and plush on the midpalate, but grippy tannins mark a tight, brisk finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a ruddy ripeness to red raspberry and cherry flavors in this delicately framed Merlot. It's crisp with acidity and enticingly spiced, but finishes abruptly.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This offering conveys blueberry, herbs, olive and tire rubber. The flavors are lighter in style, with just a hint of sweetness, trailing toward the finish. This would make an excellent and crowd-pleasing by-the-glass selection.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromatically expressive, this conveys cranberry and milk chocolate. It's full of fruit and barrel flavors with a lightly creamy feel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% varietal brings a fruit-forward profile of candied red currants, cranberry and spice. It has fresh, medium-bodied flavors, with the concentration a bit wanting.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mango, papaya and vanilla aromas are lightly tropical and chunky. The palate is plump and fair. Flavors of green melon, papaya and mixed tropical fruits finish steady and with a reprise of leesy, yeasty vanilla.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dusty, scratchy, spicy red-fruit aromas register as feral. This is wiry and medicinal in feel, with spicy black-plum flavors that are brash and oaky. Peppery spice dominates an otherwise hollow finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Half fermented in oak with the rest in stainless steel, this wine offers lees, butter and vanilla, with a dry, medium-bodied feel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This unusual blend made from Verdelho, Pinot Gris and Pinot Blanc grapes is dry, reasonably fruity and smooth in texture. It starts with canteloupe aromas, goes to golden apple flavors and leaves an earthy touch of walnut on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a dark and probably too-tannic wine. A very dry, extracted character gives bitterness more than fruit. It's still young and has the Saint-Estèphe tannins in abundance, although its future with this dryness is uncertain.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mint and graphite aromas make for a cool nose on this 50/50 Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon. Rubbery tannins mixed with extracted berry flavors create more noise than poise on the palate. A spicy, herbal, chocolaty finish is punchy and borderline punishing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Given the diverse clonal make-up of the vines that go in to this Pinot, the aromas are somewhat muted and shy. Earthy, spicy fruit flavors are characterized by baked red raspberry and strawberry notes, with the wine taking on a denseness on the palate and finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Packed with fruit, this is a fine, simple Bordeaux. Red fruits leap out of the glass, allied to light tannins. They make for a wine that's ready to drink young and fresh.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Varietal notes of potting soil, flowers and dark cherry partner with licorice and pickling spices. The fruit flavors seem sweet, almost as if carrying some residual sugar, with some mesquite flavors that distract.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While lemony-fresh with a streak of crushed-stone minerality, this medium-bodied white lacks the exuberance and spice expected of Gewürztraminer. It's refreshing and pleasing nonetheless, with a spray of lingering white blossom perfume on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine suggests green, savory herbs along with cherry and currant. It's elegant in style, velvety in feel, and delivers good concentration to the fruit flavors plus barrel notes (20% new French) on the lingering finish. The variety gets lost with the herbal notes taking over, but it still offers enjoyment.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Firm, dry tannins behind this wine give a hard edge that will need time. The wine is powered by its structure, solid and only just fruity. Wait until at least 2017 to allow more fruitiness to come through, although the wine will likely always be tough.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Berry and cassis aromas turn more saucy with airing. This has a sticky mouthfeel with protruding acids, while flavors of plum and citrus finish short. This is good if you're looking for the basics.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Whiffs of clay and fallen leaves lend an earthy tone to this ripe, rich wine. The palate is lush, almost pulpy, with black cherry and plum flavors but brisk acidity and grippy tannins finish taut and tight.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a simple, fruity wine without great tannic structure. It has attractive berry fruits and a dry core. With its fresh acidity, it will be ready to drink soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is solidly varietal, with a sleek mix of pear flesh and skin. Some tension created between the phenolic bite and tart acidity carries through into the finish. It suggests that a proper match, with a relatively oily fish perhaps, will bring out its best.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dominated by the local Duras grape, this spicy and fruity wine has an intriguing blend of juicy acidity and leathery tannins. It gives a wine that could benefit from aging while also being ready to drink now. Give it the benefit of the doubt and wait until 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Apple and pear aromas provide a smooth entry to a round, slightly creamy palate. Grapefruit, green-herb, pear and apple flavors lean toward sweet and ripe, while the finish holds onto just enough acidic zest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very deep black plum, smashed red berries, concentrated cola and coffee liqueur aromas entice the nose on this blend of 40% Cabernet Franc, 40% Zinfandel and 20% Grenache. It's very spicy and lively on the palate with an almost biting, explosive acidity. Flavors of espresso and deep red fruits are noticeable.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This has a rather deep red color and a slightly smoky rim. It offers profuse aromas of black cherry and blackberry, medium to full body and a generous texture. It's enjoyable for the fruit flavor, and easy to drink due to the soft texture. The finish is lingering and almost sweet.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "You'll taste the 40% new French oak right away, followed by crisp, botanical flavors of lime rind and green apple. It's not a fleshy Chardonnay, instead it's the mineral and botanical flavors that stand out.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this rosé has a weightiness. It's juicy, bold and dry, with a hue of freshly cut watermelon that follows on the palate, alongside dried cranberry and currant.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here's a blend of 25% Sangiovese, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 25% Syrah that opens with aromas of red currant, bell pepper and roasted coffee beans. The medium-bodied, one-dimensional palate offers dried black cherry, black pepper, espresso and a gamy note alongside moderate tannins. Drink through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the tiny vineyard area of Marcillac in the French mountains on the eastern edge of the southwest region, this tight, fruity wine is a breath of fresh air. It is packed with berry fruits as well as tannins showing that it will age. Red fruits burst out at the end. Marcillac's claim to fame is Fer Servidou, the grape that is not related to Cabernet Sauvignon but has similar aroma and taste traits.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine combines the best of Chenin Blanc, with its nutty, terroir-driven character, and the round ripeness of Chardonnay. It is fruity and fresh with a smooth texture that is lifted by final acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Forward and chunky, the fruit has the lightness and freshness of black cherry soda. It's smooth and fresh, though somewhat insubstantial, with a creamy finish and a lick of coffee as it fades.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Subdued aromas of black currant, chocolate and a whiff cedar lead the nose of this blend of 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc, 30% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot. On the palate, notes of grilled bell pepper, soy sauce and game accent a core of dried black cherry. It's simple and a bit rustic, with dusty, drying tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's quite a bit of green on this nose of this blend of 63% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Franc, 10% Cabernet Sauvingnon, 2% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot, with grilled jalapeño most prevalent. The palate is not very dense though proves dynamic, showing red cherries and elderberries laced with green peppercorns.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% Syrah offers aromas of mature black currant, charred earth and a whiff of cedar. The palate delivers dried black cherries, clove, ground pepper and powdered sage alongside raspy tannins that leave a drying, astringent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a forward, rather light, chocolaty wine. The berry fruit flavors are swathed in chocolate, and a suggestion of citrus keeps a frame around it.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A vivid gold color and spice-rack aromas like nutmeg and cardamom add a different twist to this medium-bodied and rather rich-textured wine. Those are probably characteristics from aging with oak, and they enhance the clean, fresh fruit flavors in a good way.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of bell pepper, red currant and vanilla come together in the glass along with a gamy note. The dense palate delivers dried black cherries, toasted oak, tobacco and licorice. Tightly wound, astringent tannins dry out the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of pencil shavings, black currant and cedar lead the nose of this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. The ripe, forward palate delivers dried cherries, green bell pepper and clove alongside assertive, grippy tannins. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit richness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made with 85% Merlot blended with varying amounts of Petit Verdot, Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of truffle, underbrush, baked plum and dark cooking spice. The palate delivers licorice, roasted coffee bean and blueberry extract alongside astringent tannins that dry out the palate. While the tannins are still aggressive, the fruit richness is starting to dry out.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made entirely with Sangiovese, this fresh wine opens with aromas of black cherry and freshly ground pepper that carry over to the palate along with notes of black raspberry and a hint of orange rind. Racy acidity and supple tannins provide the framework. It's easy-drinking, so enjoy soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Milk chocolate and dark plum combine to nice effect in this majority-Merlot, blended with almost 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dry, savory and spicy in cinnamon and clove, the wine is substantially dense and thick on the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Zesty cherry aromas are offset by powdery softness and floral hints. This feels solid and correct, with bright acidity. Flavors of red-apple skins and citrus fruits finish direct and clean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Firm, well-modulated and medium-bodied, this estate-grown wine brings a mix of apple flesh and skin, along with a strong scent of biscuit. and hint of vanilla. Overall it's staunchly varietal, though not especially complex.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spicy cranberry/raspberry fruit is at the heart of this bright, quaffable and value-priced wine. There's a light dusting of pepper also, but it's the fresh fruit that stands out.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lime and passion fruit aromas are subtle and appealing. This delivers a fresh, alert palate and crisp, lightly brined flavors of lettuce, apple and cucumber. On the finish, it runs peppery but not overly aggressive.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Woody aromas of sawdust and maple take over a lightly herbal bouquet. Plum, raspberry and chocolaty oak flavors finish herbal and resiny.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Muskateller is a powerhouse Muscat grape, chock full of buoyant stone fruit, melon and floral aromas. It's an unabashedly fruity, flamboyantly forward grape, but this off-dry example is brisk and balanced.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a bargain-priced blend of Grenache, Syrah, Carignan, Mourvèdre and Cinsault. The flavors are ripe and plummy, accented by hints of garrigue, while the tannins are modest and supple.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The varieties in the blend include Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Viognier. They come together to offer hints of pineapple, pear and citrus. There's a silky texture on the palate, then a clean, crisp finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plush, ripe apple and apricots are dusted in savory, earthy notes of slate and spice. It's a dancing, delicately framed wine with a balance of soft, sweet fruit and zesty acidity. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "So easy to enjoy, this mild-tasting but full-bodied wine is fruity in flavor and soft in texture. It has an earthy, savory aroma, generous plum and berry flavors, a mineral influence, light tannins and a lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Subtle honeysuckle, orange and apricot aromas lead to nicely tangy fruit flavors, medium body and good crisp acidity. This is a well-balanced, vibrant and refreshing wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Woody in aroma, this is an exceptionally light-bodied, floral and herbal white, marked most by its high-pitched acidity that threatens to veer into extreme territory. Instead, beeswax and white peach figure into the mix, finishing in a refreshing twist of lemon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This densely flavored and full-bodied wine has a very deep, dark color and aromas that suggest oak barrels, nutmeg and cardamom. The palate shows tension between firm tannins and acidity, and carries ripe blackberries, with spicy accents. Drink now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With a dominance of Pinot Meunier in the blend, this soft, attractive wine offers apples and crisp citrus, with a light, lively texture. The wine, with its fresh aftertaste, is refreshing and bright.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is certified organic, from one of Oregon's leading vineyards. Somewhat muted in this cool, wet vintage, it's nonetheless a sturdy effort with a potent herbal component. The stiff red fruits conjure up a tart cranberry and cherry mix.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine offers a bouquet of raspberry and smoked meat with a touch of bell pepper. Flavors of black cherry, smoked meat, black pepper and eucalyptus mingle on the palate, with savory notes outweighing fruit. Soft tannins coat the mouth, and ultimately black cherry lingers on the back palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deep ruby in the glass, this wine has a bouquet of black currant, flint and bell pepper. A restrained tannic structure supports flavors of blackberry, damson plum, elderberry, violet and espresso with an added touch of bramble. The finish is marked by a note of fresh summer plum.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Boysenberry and exotic notes of all-spice and cardamom set this Malbec apart from the field. In the mouth, this is typically angular, with sharp acidity and not much cushion. A one-note, linear flavor of rooty plum is neither fruity nor dry, while the finish fails to rise or fall; it just hums along on a singular beam of acid. Drink from 2018–2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Slightly muted aromatically and on the palate, this sports clean and fresh cherry fruit, with a pleasing suggestion of minerality. The midpalate feels a bit hollow.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Baking spice, dried flower, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of coconut lead the nose on this straightforward Barolo. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, toast and vanilla alongside firm, tightly knit tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rather reserved in aromas for a dessert wine, this allows blackberry, black pepper and mineral notes to emerge with time. The palate is lightly sweet, with ripe blackberry and blueberry-jam flavors, made interesting with a pencil-lead minerality throughout.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sun-ripened mango and pineapple flavors lend a lavish, tropical feel to this off-dry Riesling. At the same time, there's a resolute core of acidity that gives it balance and grace. It's concentrated and fruity but maintains vitality and length.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Brisk and bright, this delicately framed Pinot Noir offers both elegance and thirst-quenching quaffability. It's fresh and primary, bursting of raspberry and blossom, but finishes suprisingly long with a murmur of feathery tannin. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Papaya and stone-fruit aromas are fleshy and a touch green and grassy, giving way to dustiness upon airing. This feels spritzy and good, with a full complement of golden apple, white grape and green plum flavors. Solid, stony and minerally on the finish, with a hint of tropical fruit flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a lot of slate minerality on the nose of this bottling, alongside bright and fresh boysenberry fruit and a pine-needle character. The palate is tart with plum skin and grippy tannins, well balanced and also showing just the right amount of barnyard funk.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh cherry and plum aromas are a bit scratchy but alert. This feels firm, with bright acidity creating a raw sense on the palate. Plum, berry and a pinch of saltiness make for an authentic flavor profile, while this finishes long and steady. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This linear red offers savory fruit flavors of ripe wild cherry, juicy strawberry, toast, white pepper and a hint of grilled herb. Fine-grained, drying tannins provide support. Drink after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoked beef, tart and tangy boysenberry jelly, black rocks and a cigar-box scent power the nose of this wine from an award-winning vineyard. The palate offers ample juicy tang along with chewy tannins, with dark chocolate, black cherry, and black olive enlivening the mouth.\n",

      "This offer aromas of plum jam, Oriental spice, underbrush and a whiff of blue flower. The lively, approachable palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry, white pepper and clove alongside vibrant acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Named after a trail in the Grand Canyon, this Napa-made bottling shows Japanese pear and cracked vanilla candy on a complex nose. It offers ample amounts of minerality, from slate to chalk, on the palate, followed by smoked stone fruit in the middle and pencil-lead elements toward the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rubbery, earthy aromas of berry fruits, plum and mushroom are solid but nondescript. This feels grabby and pinchy, with herbal, leafy, salty flavors that end with loamy plum and prune notes. Overall, this is big and forceful. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rose, violet, wild berry and menthol aromas unfold in the glass. The bracing palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and clove alongside assertive, close-grained tannins that leave a mouth-puckering finish. Drink after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A crisp and dry Vouvray, this still has those telltale honey flavors of delicious Chenin. It is rich and dense while also having great acidity and a tight, taut texture that will soften as the wine ages. It can be drunk now for its freshness, but it will be better from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mature berry, dark cooking spice and blue flower are some of the aromas that emerge on this firm red. On the palate, ground pepper, clove and licorice accent a black cherry core while brisk acidity provides the racy framework.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Leather, pencil shavings and cedar provide an edge to this wine. It's otherwise soft and approachable in a mix of blackberry and black cherry, a seasoning of cinnamon and clove providing a pleasant hit of spice on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of wild berry, menthol, baking spice and a balsamic note lead the nose. On the tightly wound palate, bracing tannins support raw cherry, anise, tobacco and a hint of coffee alongside firm acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hints of bramble and earth lend savory nuances to sunny yellow peach and melon flavors in this bright vivaciously crisp Kabinett. Off-dry in style, it's balanced by a stream of focused tangerine acidity leading from midpalate through a moderately long finish. Start drinking now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Concentrated rose petals, hibiscus and purple fruits meld with lava-rock aromas, all boosted by a touch of cola and smoke. Tart plum skins and Montgomery cherries play into the complex palate, which also shows turned earth and beef-jerky flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is 100% varietal, and sports interesting aromas of Provençal herbs. Peppery cranberry fruit is spicy and tart, fading through the midpalate into a lean, but lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dusty mineral and dried herb notes lend a savory tone to this elegant semisweet Riesling. The palate is intensely fruity, with ripe nectarine and tangerine flavors. It finishes moderately long, with a wet-stone minerality.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fragrances of apple, pear and citrus carry over to the palate, along with pineapple and banana sensations. It has a fine, persistent perlage and a bone-dry finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoke and earth lend a savory tone to fresh apple and lemon aromas on this dry, intensely concentrated Riesling. It's bold and weighty on the palate, but energized by a strike of lemon-lime acidity and soft white peach tones that linger on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark and brooding in savory mushroom yumminess, Paul Hobbs' more affordable Pinot Noir offers dark cherry and spice in good proportion. Concentrated, lush and perfumed it'll accompany a range of foods enjoyably.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This full-bodied white leads with delicate aromas of lychee, Spanish broom and golden apples. The juicy, round palate delivers pear, apple and hints of baking spice brightened by fresh acidity that gives a clean, persistent finish.\n",

      "Young and snappy with crisp green apple fruit flavors, this racy and nicely textured Pinot Gris shows excellent balance, concentration and length. Delicious now and should improve through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is no mistaking the purple chequered bottle of this wine. In its just off-dry character, it retains a light crispness, fresh apples and a soft, fruity feel. An attractive tang at the end makes it a good apéritif.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In this 2012 reserve, the fruit is sourced entirely from the Black Family estate vineyard. It's got medium concentration with cherry fruit the focus, enhanced with flavors of cola and truffle. Still quite young, the wine feels slightly disjointed; a second bottle was similar. Give this one additional bottle age.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a big, tough, tight and somewhat puzzling Pinot Noir. It's bone dry, moderate in alcohol and tart in acidity, with sour red cherry, cranberry, Dr. Pepper cola and new French oak flavors. It's hard and rude right now, although its inherent elegance shines through. The question is ageability. Give it until 2018 and see what it's doing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A structured wine, it has the weight and the firm tannins to give it aging potential. Black cherries, dark fruits and juicy acidity are paired with the drier tannic structure, amking for a smooth and rich wine. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the third wine of classed growth Château Grand-Puy-Lacoste, a charming offspring of the more serious grand vin. It shows lively black fruits, touches of wood and balanced acidity. It's a wine to drink young and fruity, so open from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with intense floral aromas that recall white roses, lemon zest and apricot. The linear, vibrant palate offers pink grapefruit, white peach and a flint note alongside crisp acidity that leaves a refreshing finish. Oliver McCrum, T. Edward Wines.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Another fine example of Bechthold's dry-farmed, old, gnarled-vine beauty in a glass, this wine is light in color and high-toned in cherry and rhubarb fruit. Buoyed by acidity, the finish offers just a light seasoning of pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The vineyard is on Westside Road, in the warmer part of the valley. The wine is gentle, balanced and immediately likeable for its array of raspberries, cherries and cola. Heat from alcohol makes it a little ungainly, and may limit ageability. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a well-balanced blend of Aragonez, Trincadeira and Syrah. With its straight line in black fruits, dark tannins and lively acidity, it shows a fine structure and a good future. Touches of leather, chocolate and the wood aging all add interest. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Good for Burgess for holding this Syrah back for a little while. It's beginning to soften, just barely. The tannins are still strong, but you can taste those bright blackberries and cherries starting to show meaty hints of wild grilled portobello mushrooms. It will drink well in late 2014 with hearty roasts and stews.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of freshly cut flowers, green apple, lime and white peach leap from the glass. The creamy texture is brightened by lively acidity. It's simple but well executed.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This full-bodied Pinot Grigio opens with aromas of tropical fruit, melon and stone fruit. The concentrated palate delvers yellow peach, mature pear and juicy pineapple alongside notes of aromatic herbs.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of Sangiovese and Malvasia, this wine conveys aromas of espresso, roasted coffee bean, black fruit and mint. The palate offers oak, vanilla, toast, coffee, black cherry, black pepper and grilled balsamic herbs. It's soft and already accessible. Drink now through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Boyd Cantenac's second wine is a soft and plump. It has ripe tannins and a generous texture, along with a gentle structure and good depth of flavor. The black fruits are already well integrated with the tannins to give a rich and juicy wine. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Prickly aromas of herbal fruits, tar and hard spices turn more jammy and wayward with airing. This feels on the heavy and chunky side, while flavors of green herbs, olive, buttery oak and mossy black fruits finish with a high percentage of body fat versus lean muscle.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe bramble notes accent pristine raspberry and cherry notes in this bright, remarkably juicy Spätburgunder. It's zippy and fresh on the palate, with a spray of cranberry flavor that wraps up nicely in a coat of velvet tannins on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoke and crushed mineral notes, along with a lean, herbal tone, make this off-dry Riesling especially elegant and savory in style. Lime zest and lemon flavors fill the mouth with vital energy. It finishes moderately long, on a juicy tangerine note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Initial notes of earth and dust blow off with aeration to reveal pretty white floral and peach aromas. Off dry in style, the palate is concentrated with ripe honeydew flavor against a backdrop of steely, linear acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A strongly wood-aged wine, it is packed with toast and vanilla, but has a hard time remembering the fruit. At the moment, the wine has weight, the lightest hints of ripe tropical flavors and acidity. It needs more aging to broaden out and allow the fruit to sing. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is as much fruit as structure in this wine. Ripe red fruits are supported by solid tannins while pushing out fragrant acidity. It has structure while also allowing room for final fruitiness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A smooth and rounded wine, it has ripe plum and spice flavors to go with soft tannins. A smoky character, juicy fruit and acidity show an open, friendly aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a transition vintage, in which Alex Sokol Blosser has taken over the principal winemaker duties. This is a delicate, well-structured effort, showing an aromatic mix of cherry blossoms, clove and orange peel notes. Refined raspberry and cherry fruit carries a streak of tarragon, and finishes just slightly bitter.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Whole-cluster pressed and barrel fermented, this is a deep gold, and opens powerfully with scents of buttered fruit and nuts. It's rich and creamy, showing toast and other barrel tones ahead of any specific fruit. Drink now through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of Spanish broom, acacia and oak lead the nose. The vibrant palate offers yellow apple, citrus, toasted hazel nut and mineral alongside lively acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Some flinty notes precede earthier, ripe apple notes that also spread across the palate. There is a textured mouthfeel, while a clean seam of lemon crispness counters the earthy fruit. Texture and freshness linger pleasantly.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a ripe, jammy wine with red plum and sweet strawberry fruits that are cut by both the acidity and the toasty tannins. Although ripe, the wine offers attractive juicy freshness. The aftertaste brings out more of the tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "What appears as apply, plummy fruit on the nose gains ample spice on the palate. Fermented and aged in used barriques, this wine has an unusual style that really demands food. It's fresh and fruity but with added roundness from wood.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crisp and linear, this offers delicate aromas of Spanish broom and orchard fruit. The vibrant palate offers fresh green apple and juicy citrus while energizing mineral backs up the fresh, flinty finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a fully oaken, reserve-level wine with decadent yellow wax that's concentrated and ripe on the palate in toffee, vanilla and baked apple pie. Robust, it drinks decadently.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This spent 18 months in French oak and three years in bottle, ahead of an April 2016 release. Light and elegant, it carries a whiff and taste of leather, with earthy, slightly grainy tannins. With air, the strawberry fruit gains some flesh. Decant it and drink now through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a fruity wine with lively acidity and a brisk, zingy character. Freshness shoots through the wine, making it lively with hints of yellow fruits. The aftertaste is crisp and ripe.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is quite a funky, gamey blend of 33% Grenache, 33% Syrah, 30% Mourvèdre and 4% Alicante Bouschet, with beef carpaccio, concentrated plum and tobacco aromas. Dried beef, dried purple-flowers, asphalt, condensed black-pepper and deep balsamic-reduction flavors are laced through a charred palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A grippy, densely concentrated and full-bodied wine, which will benefit from vigorous swirling or cellaring, there are hints of black fruit, leather saddle and cedar at its edges, waiting to grow wings. Drink now through 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It's a subtle and light wine, yet it captures the elegantly refined gravitas of the grape. Suggestions of root beer and cola wrap around strawberry fruit. There's a hint of dill and an impression of clean earth. Decant this and it greatly improves.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Alluring aromas of citrus, white flower and a whiff of tropical fruit come together on this. The racy palate offers lemon zest, mango, sage, saline and an almond note alongside vibrant acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This soft, rounded wine has attractive ripe white-stone-fruit flavor. It also has a rich, spicy side, with light hints of wood that give it a mellow character. The wine is developing well and will be ready from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soft apple notes on nose and palate make for a subtle, soft but fresh wine. The fruitiness is there but not in the foreground, just coloring this friendly, lightly textured wine with flavor. Drink soon; it will be at its best with equally subtle food or soft cheeses.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is delicately scented with whispers of yellow flower, spring blossom and woodland berry. The lively palate delivers crushed strawberry, nectarine, juicy cherry and fennel while a mineral vein energizes the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Austere notes of crushed minerals on the nose belie the punch of peach and melon that await in the palate of this off-dry Riesling. It's a spry but penetrating fruity wine balanced by zesty acidity and a floral touch that lingers on the finish. Drink now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Napoleon's secret was that he liked Syrah in his Bordeaux blends, so this mix of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Syrah, 13% Cabernet Franc, 12% Merlot, 4% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot shows why, offering fresh and vibrant aromas of blueberry and licorice candy. Bright blackberry preserves pop on the palate as does fudge in this easy-drinking wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This reserve-level cuvée spent eight months in 55% new French oak, and can benefit from additional bottle age. Tightly wound flavors of red berries and red licorice carry a hint of watery chocolate. But there isn't the expected depth or power here, given its place in the winery's Pinot Noir hierarchy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made entirely with Nerello Cappuccio, this reveals aromas of raspberry compote, tilled earth, ripe berry and grilled herb. The juicy palate delivers fleshy black cherry, licorice, white pepper and a hint of sage alongside bright acidity and smooth tannins. It's already accessible. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made with Nero d'Avola and Perricone, this offers alluring aromas of red berry, spice and a floral note. The bright, immediate palate offers succulent wild cherry, crushed raspberry nectarine zest and a hint of baking spice alongside zesty acidity that leads to a crisp, clean finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lively and fragrant notes of ripe pear and red apple are immensely appetizing, while the palate is edged with its very own spiciness. The totally moreish ripe-apple freshness pervades and illuminates everything and echoes long. Drink soon while aromas are at their peak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Delicately scented, this offers aromas of honeysuckle, citrus blossom and pear while the round, juicy palate doles out white peach, mature apple and Mediterranean herb. A hint of almond closes the clean, lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fermented and aged in acacia barrels, this deeply colored white has aromas of candied citrus, mature apple, toast and honey. The honeyed note carries over to the evolved palate along with yellow apple skin, coffee, dried herb and a hint of smoke. A walnut note marks the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of red fruit and dark spice shows on the nose of this wine, with dried strawberry and red cherry running into licorice, purple flowers and black slate. The flavors are broad with cherry candy notes, boosted by a boisterous pepper spice, and settling into a decently tart finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine has an attractive cedary, floral aroma, rich fruit accents and a suave streak of new-oak flavor that adds spice and an extra dimension of mouthfeel. It is full-bodied, saturated with fine tannins and has a bold personality.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lively nutty and citrus aromas meet apple and lime flavors in this full-bodied and mouth-watering wine. It has fresh acidity to counter a fairly rich texture, and the resulting balance reinforces the bright flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very familiar Rioja aromas of cherry, plum and prune scream Tempranillo. This is wiry in feel, with tight, hammering acidity. Berry and black-cherry flavors finish on a subtle note of chocolate along with a final shot of juicy, sharp acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from organic grapes, this well-proportioned wine has light oak aromas, classic cherry and black plum flavors, and touches of black olive and herbs. There is something mouthwatering about the firm tannins and acidity, and these will help it pair well with food.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Inman has not offered much Chardonnay before, but this one is highly distinctive, light as a feather, floral, crisp and citrusy, basking in Chablis-like, wet stone minerality. Those looking for butter and oak should travel elsewhere; at a preposterously unheard of 11.6% alcohol, this wine offers silky, subtle intrigue.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe yellow fruits and fragrant acidity dominate this bright, fruity wine. It has a light touch of minerality and a tight steely texture that is full of zest, giving a layered structure of fruit and acidity. The wine, one of the Kuentz-Bas biodynamic range, should age, so drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh tomato, plum, herb and spice aromas are authentic. A medium bodied palate is lifted and elegant. Flavors of woody spice, light herb, raspberry and red plum finish racy, with hints of cocoa and white pepper. Among Chilean Pinot Noirs, this is at the top of its field.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a myriad of wonderful vineyards, this vibrant wine offers an incredible deal at the price, with a lively bouquet of fennel, apple and pear. Chalky in texture with delicious acidity, it has baking spices popping up on balanced finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Notes of violet, preserved plums and cherries persist throughout this lush, concentrated Pinot Noir. It's medium-bodied in style, with crisp acidity, yet the palate seems to build in richness and body. The finish brings elegant, fine-grained tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made cryogenically, this sweet late harvest-style wine—which clocks in at 165 g/L residual sugar—delivers a lot of decadent flavor. Honey and tea—unctuous and peachy—coat the tongue while remaining on the right side of cloying. Streaks of vanilla and butter cookie come into play as well.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Named after winemaker David Corey's son, this 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot and 3% Merlot begins with nose-tickling scents of berry syrup and smoked cigars. The maduro cigar flavor consumes the palate, with black cherry fruit and smooth tannins. It can stand up to a fat stogie or gamy meats like lamb.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Layers of mushroom, savory spice, and earth lend depth and complexity to luscious red raspberry and cherry flavors in this complex, standout Cabernet Franc. Tart cranberry cuts through the supple and silky palate, leading to a cool, mineral finish.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a barrel-aged, punch-in-the-face blend of 62% Grenache and 38% Mourvèdre from Santa Maria-based winemaker Dave Corey, who sources most of his fruit from the Cuyama Valley. Its cherry syrup nose dives into a thick, juicy palate, heavily spiced with tobacco, laden with chalky tannins and ending with vanilla.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Of all the 2012 releases from Mannina, this is the most dense, dark and substantial. Cassis and black cherry fruit is set against a stiff streak of char and coffee, backed with firm, ripe tannins. The length and balance are just right for ripe fruit from young vines.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 19% Cab Franc and 10% Petit Verdot is sourced from the Hedges, Stillwater, and Conner Lee vineyards. At first soft and smooth, it morphs into a textural wine with a mouthful of purple and black fruits—from blackberry on through cassis. Streaks of smoke, graphite and espresso highlight the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Charred beef tips, grilled whole fish, wet dirt and heavy tar combine for a pungent, serious nose on this Syrah from a vineyard planted by Central Coast pioneer Dale Hampton.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With tight, crisp aromas of berry fruit, toast, mineral and mint, this Cabernet Sauvignon blend is high toned—coming across racy and snappy. Jumpy, lively plum and raspberry flavors are backed by leafy, herbal notes and resiny oak. A spicy mint finish concludes this energetic yet oaky blend. Drink through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a vineyard in the heart of Rutherford replanted in time to make the 2010 vintage, this Tonella Cabernet is dark black and dense in black cherry, tobacco and chocolate. Ready to age until 2017 or so, the wine imparts a lift of acidity on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Granite and red cherry notes are reminiscent of fine Beaujolais in this surprisingly tasty Hudson River Gamay. Cranberry and cherry flavors are tangy and revitalizing, nuanced by fresh herbs and leaves. It's elegant and sprightly through a moderately long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "One of Santa Barbara County's pioneer properties delivers an aromatically luscious wine, with aromas of white flowers, French toast, quince and lime sorbet on the nose. It's a bit like sipping perfume of tuberose and honeysuckle, yet there is bouncy acidity and chalky minerality, ensuring an emerging shelf life through 2018.\n",

      "One of the rare vineyards which can produce Grand Cru Sylvaner, Zotzenberg's chalk soil gives a mineral while juicy and fresh wine. The lightest hint of spice gives the wine some weight, and the ripe, fruity apples and creamed pear are already delicious. Not for aging.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full-bodied and lush on the palate, this exuberant wine offers a brightness of red raspberry fruit followed by acres of lively clove and ginger spice. High in acidity, it has years to go before it sleeps, the finish savory in leather.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This leads off with aromas of mature black fruit, toasted oak, coffee bean and a whiff of balsamic herbs. The ripe palate delivers fleshy red cherry and black raspberry with layers of cocoa, espresso and sage alongside bracing tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pretty aromas suggest violet, sandalwood, incense, plum and chocolate. The ripe palate offers crushed black cherry, mocha, espresso and vanilla alongside firm tannins. A licorice note signals the close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe plum fruits give this big and fruity wine from the 130-acre Castéra vineyard a rich character. The structure provides a fine support with tannins that bring out the concentrated blackberry fruits. It's full of potential; drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A well constructed, solid wine, this has a fine layer of firm tannins that melds well with the rich black plums and acidity. Even this young, the wine is showing a balanced character, warm and ripe. It will age, so drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Winemaker Kristy Melton continues to show a sense of restraint in her wines. This Merlot provides a classic example, concentrated in dusty red fruit and smooth, supple tannins, a sideways glance of cinnamon and clove flirting thoughout. Structure and elegance reign here over power and oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Expertly integrated butter elements mix with peach and lime spritz on the nose. This single-vineyard Chardonnay offers stone fruit flavors, slight sea saltiness and a long vanilla finish for very easy drinking.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A tremendously well-made Chardonnay at the price and production levels, this is lean in high-toned acidity but offers tropical goodness, a swath of lime throughout. Balanced and tense, the twist of lime comes back on the finish. This is a great wine to stock up on for larger gatherings.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This structured wine features an enticing fragrance of red rose petal, blue flower and a whiff of crushed red berry. The robust palate delivers juicy black cherry layered with notes of spice, vanilla, tobacco and anisette alongside firm tannins that need time to unfold.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This brilliant straw colored Chardonnay has aromas of lemon blossoms and green apples. On the palate, it's smooth and clean with flavors of lemon curd and baked apple.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fragrances suggest wild berry layered with notes of forest floor, red rose, leather, clove and balsam. On the palate, sage, thyme and espresso back up sensations of ripe Morello cherry alongside tightly woven and assertive tannins that need time to unwind. Drink 2016–2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This powerful Cabernet Sauvignon calls on 13% Malbec to further its brawn, the mix spending two years in entirely new French oak. Hugely muscular, it needs time to calm its masterfully ripe fruit and dark layers of clove spice, and to further soften its tannins and coax out the shy component of herb. The vineyard behind the wine is Bismark within the newly named Moon Mountain District.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine has overlapping personalities. One drips richly in vanilla and honey, while the other is lemony tart and electric in acidity. They commingle on the finish, and will clearly decide whether to get along or part over time. Give the wine a good swirl.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Steely yet somewhat sweet, it offers a richness of baked apple and pear amid midweight layers of softened tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Supple at the core, this wine is framed by a medium amount of chewy tannins that give traction to the high-toned flavors of tobacco, vanilla and earthy spices.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With attractive lemon flavors within a smooth and rich wine, this is both bright and ripe. It's aromatic and full in the mouth, showing apple, peach and mineral tones. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Informal and simple, it offers bright red cherry-berry fruit, sweet cake spices and hints of alpine herbs. The silky smooth tannins and fresh acidity make this already extremely accessible so enjoy now–2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pink lemonade and cherry pie mesh together into a strong, slightly boozy aroma on this adventurous blend of 30% Petite Sirah, 30% Syrah, 30% Grenache and 10% Tannat from Matt Villard's Petite Sirah-focused project. Cherry and orange juice dominate the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This forward wine opens with funky aromas of game and leather, with a whiff of barnyard. The palate is evolved and much of the fruit has already dried up, leaving bitter prune alongside green, astringent tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rustic aromas recall barnyard, game and overripe black fruit. The palate offers mature plum layered with chocolate, vanilla and game, with extremely astringent tannins that give a drying, lean finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ruby garnet in color, this has aromas of red plums, purple flowers and black fruit conserves. There are nice bright fruit flavors on the palate, with touches of tobacco leaf and tart cherry on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Berry and plum aromas come with a hard oak topping that's hinting at paint and turpentine. The palate is juicy and tannic, with flavors of plum, berry, minty herbs and oak. The finish is rubbery and hot, with oaky leftovers.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of grilled herbs, barbecue sauce and pressed flowers are bold and delineated. Medium in weight, it has a soft core framed by lean tannins and bright acids.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Firm dark-berry aromas come with cola and leafy notes that feel tannic and gripping but alive. Big berry and black plum flavors are leafy and spicy in style. It finishes tight, but should open and relax with a bit of time in the glass, and would go well with pizza and burgers.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine shows apparent barrel aging on the nose, with vanilla bean and coconut oil alongside caramelized apricot aromas. There is a very ripe papaya and guava tropicality on the palate, with a slight finish of iodine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Focused scents of white peach, salumi and yellow apple mark this blend of 50% Chardonnay and 50% Sauvignon Blanc. Lax acidity makes the wine feel tensionless. A note of apple juice marks the medium-long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Expressive of dill, licorice and cherry flavors, the palate bears firm tannins and balanced acids.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sampled in a half bottle, this unusual version of a Muscat (most are off-dry) was quite tart, with potent flavors of citrus flesh and rind. Not as much orange flavor as one might expect, it's more in the lemon/grapefruit camp.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Concentrated berry aromas are basic and hint at sugar beets. This feels jammy and a bit syrupy, while robust berry, beet and chocolate flavors finish a touch heavy and sticky. For the money, this is generous and plenty good.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full, pushy aromas of stewed plum, tomato, herbs and heavy oak come in front of a high-acid palate with salty flavors of herbal red plum, oregano, basil and tomato. A saline character sits heavily on the wine's chunky finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "As fresh as can be, this is a bright, lively and lightly perfumed wine. It has grapefruit, apricot fruit and a touch of minerality. Drink through 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With its intense spice and rich texture, the wine seems bigger than it is. In fact, it is fresh while soft and very aromatic, with a pale salmon color. It's delicious, smooth and ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Brûléed pastry crust and salted butter aromas overlay golden apple and spiced pear tones. The palate feels lax with curved acids, which lead to a light, yielding finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is soft, showing ripe apple fruits, pears and apricots, with fresh acidity. It's light, but has a strong sense of texture and minerality. It's ready to drink but will be better early in 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This aged Riesling is medium gold colored, with pleasant aromas of lemon peel and petrol. It is round and generous on the palate, with flavors of lemon custard and green olive tapenade. The finish is long, with lingering flavors of lemon pith.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright plum and berry aromas are clear but basic. In the mouth, this young wine is crisp, tannic and a touch citric. Wild berry flavors dance alongside peppery spice notes, while the finish is zesty, a touch bitter and hot.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of dust and stewed plums give a pleasing entry, but once sipped the wine tastes like it needs more time to mature. The flavors approach strawberry and other red fruits, but remain quite tart and tannic.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A pretty strawberry-colored rosé, this shows uniform scents and flavors of strawberry, with a peppery kick in the finish. It was fermented in neutral French oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is light, fresh and fruity. Red berry flavors come through strongly along with crisp acidity and the lightest touch of tannin. You can't miss the acidity at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A big, ripe and jammy wine made from old vines. There are black plum fruits but the wine is dominated by licorice, black coffee and wood. It is powerful and very solid. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light in color it reveals intense aromas of ripe, baked cherry fruit and pungent earth, streaks of herbal cinnamon and clove playing in the background.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Concentrated toast and golden apple notes carry onto the round, medium- to full-bodied palate, which comes with bright acids, a white peach flavor and a sense of flesh.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tart Mandarin orange rind is woven into riper aromas of Anjou pear and honey butter on the nose of this wine. Its palate is Chablis-like, with lime, lemon and kumquat flavors, strung from a nervy, chalky spine, finishing with limestone and gravel touches.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big, powerful and confidently ripe, this full-bodied wine oozes with luscious blackberry, wild sage and blueberry flavors that seemingly melt in the mouth. A great example of the late harvest style without being sweet, it's dry, concentrated and persistent on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Named for the special format of small oak barrel it's aged in, this has soaked up the oak impressively. Hints of vanilla and graham crackers accent mixed berry fruit, while the finish is long and mouthwatering. There's ample concentration, yet the wine never seems heavy. Drinkable now, but why rush things? Drink 2020–2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Truffle, leather, mature black-skinned fruit and carob aromas emerge from this powerful red. The full-bodied palate delivers succulent wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice, pipe tobacco and grilled herb flavors with big, chewy tannins. Drink 2019–2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A touch of flinty reduction clings to the nose but soon relaxes into soft notes of ripe black cherry. The palate is textured and dry, harmonious with fruit and the gentle ripple and crunch of slightly rustic but utterly pleasant tannins. This seems to be its perfect drinking window now: generous with fruit, utterly harmonious and starting to mellow. The finish is fresh, clean and totally moreish. If you can resist at all, this may well continue to develop. Drink now through 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Seared lemon, hazelnut, brown butter and sandalwood with a graphite minerality come through on the nose of this complex wine from Jonathan Nagy. The palate offers hints of herbs and chamomile at first, then washes of citrusy acidity and apple notes, all held together with steely tension.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh blackberry and boysenberry aromas meld with rose petal and hickory smoke on the warm entry of this bottling from Jonathan Nagy. The palate is packed with peppery spice, bright red cherry, thyme and root beer flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Forest floor, truffle, new leather, ripe berry and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find in this delicious red. The fresh, chewy palate doles out fleshy black cherry, chopped mint and white pepper notes, while big, round tannins provide structure. It's already enjoyable but will offer years of fine drinking. Enjoy 2018–2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This purple-tinted Carignan is a concentrated number with familiar varietal and regional aromas of latex, graphite, schist, tire rubber and black fruits. In the mouth, this is chewy and full bodied, but not heavy. Oaky spicy blackberry and nutmeg flavors linger on a mildly woody, extracted and gritty finish. Best to give this a few more years so drink through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine from this estate perched high above Château Angélus is tight and mineral. While the dark dense tannins are to the fore, it also has great fruits. The acidity and the crisp texture give the wine both its intensity and its potential. Drink from 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Packed with the dark tannins and structure of Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine, produced by the team of Calon Ségur is intense, concentrated and dark. It has a firm structure, solid and with a luscious aftertaste. The acidity of the year just shows at the end. Drink from 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Owned by the Vialard family, this is a very fine wine. While it does have strong wood flavors at this young stage, they are going to be there to support the ripe jammy fruit. The wine from this 111-acre estate is generous and is going to age well. Drink from 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The second wine of Cos d'Estournel is powerfully packed with tannins and dark ripe fruit. It is enormously rich and intense while keeping a fine smooth texture. There is a dark core that is going to allow the wine to develop over many years. Drink from 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a deliciously balanced wine. Spice from the wood aging makes a happy contrast with the black-currant fruit and acidity. It is elegant and with great fruitiness. The wine, with its tannic base, will age well. The estate is to the west of Saint-Emilion, close to Château Figeac. Drink from 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The tannins and density of this wine are impressive. With its strong structure and concentrated fruit, the wine is ripe and likely to age well. Blackberry and red-cherry flavors dominate a wine that is going to be ready to drink from 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This graceful, light-bodied wine from a promising new brand smells of strawberries and cream and tastes fresh and well-balanced. Red cherry, strawberry and clove notes blend with the creamy texture, leaving a soft but lightly tannic feel on the tongue that makes the wine even more appetizing and complete.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is the merest hint of chamomile lift on the nose, pulling all the other flavors heavenwards with it. There is apple as well as lemon zest. The palate is wonderfully pure and totally dry. Here and there more herbal inflections show and more mellow hints of baked apple. This is dry, taut and aromatic, but also clean-cut and precise. Lovely now but with definite aging potential. Drink now through 2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A slightly brooding nose suggests brambly fruit as well as freshness. The palate crunches with red and black cherry, imbued with a kind of boyish impish joy. This is disarmingly rustic, but also very, very unusual and utterly moreish in its singular and honest simplicity. Drying tannins coat the mouth while juicy tart freshness makes you want to take another sip. This is all about stormy, romantic wilderness. Beware, this might just steal your heart.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Brilliant golden color promises richness. The nose obliges with a seamless scent of apples: fresh and ripe, baked and mellow. The palate shows soaring freshness, but countless notions swirl on the dry palate of this traditional field blend: citrus and apple, pear and blossom. There is so much fruit, so much expression, this is pure exuberance, but in a rather grown-up way. A very apt expression of both the freshness and the richness of Alsace.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Heady notes of dried pear mingle with pleasant notes of earth. The palate is totally fluid and concentrated, streamlined with freshness but characterized by a rich luscious vein of sweetness. This is a late harvest to be reckoned with. Concentration and length are impressive and are just now getting into their stride.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is just a faint touch of honeysuckle on the nose. The palate follows with creamy floral peach notes on an incredibly light-bodied fluid palate of great intensity and stony depth. It is only on the aftertaste that the full volume and power of these aromatics shine. This feels like the aromatic heart of Alsace itself.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With a sizable presence on the nose and a palate evocative of black cherry, strawberry compote and orange peel, this wine speaks volumes in terms of texture and body. Its full-bodied concentration is supported by generous oak. Despite all that power, the tannins remain demure and relatively well behaved.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Winemaker Kenneth Juhasz sources fruit from the Ranch House Block within the larger Durell Vineyard for this wine. From Wente clones, it offers intensity and bracing acidity—a crisp, bright and stony celebration that's both lovely and sublime. Its gravelly texture recalls rock candy and apple sprinkled with spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The vineyard from which this wine is sourced sits along the Gualala River in view of the Pacific Ocean, enjoying coastal weather and elevations of up to 1,100 feet. Baked blueberry pie laced with clove is the first impression, supported by bright acidity. Exotic in profile, it imparts cedar and tea notes, its tannins fine yet tenacious.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe black-fruit aromas are cuddly and reflect the warm conditions of 2012. Tight and ribbed on the palate, this has the structure to handle blackberry, chocolate and peppery spice flavors without seeming overripe or jammy. A saturated finish benefits from the right amount of acidity. Drink through 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe plum, tobacco, dark spice and balsamic aromas adorn this invigorating red. Firm and full-bodied, the palate delivers wild cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and grilled herb flavors with a backbone of youthful, bracing tannins. It's already tempting but give it time to fully come around. Drink 2020–2032.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A lavish deep blend of 66% Mourvèdre and 34% Tannat, this is not for the faint of heart or weak in spirit. Pitch black in the glass, it shows espresso, vanilla, caramel and leather touches on the nose. Black cherry and crème de cassis flavors pop on the palate, with strong coffee-like tannins and a creamy vanilla finish. It's still quite young.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This tiny hands-on artisanal producer has a particular gift for expressing the fruit of the Maresh vineyard, which was originally planted 45 years ago. This new release is elegant and aromatic, with precise details throughout. Fresh raspberries, light chocolate, a hint of nougat and persistent length are all part of the equation. Drink now through 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Owned by the Wrights, this vineyard delivers smooth, forward, full-bodied flavors of cranberry, raspberry and blue plum. There's a tart snap to the fruit, and a clear sense that it has the structure and depth to develop nicely over the next decade or longer.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's something almost Grenache-like in the flavors here, which are focused, youthful and packed with ripe red fruits. It's tart and well-tempered, and lingers gracefully. Hints of orange peel lead into an impression of orange liqueur, framing the supple tannins. Drink now through 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While sunny melon and peach flavors are forward and fruity, an underlining of chalky minerality lends finesse and elegance to this dry, neatly composed wine. It feels sprightly on the palate, finishing briskly on a lifted white-blossom note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Thick and rich, this is a wine of breadth and depth, yeasty in baked bread and ripe in fresh raspberry. The proceedings are accented in Asian spice and black pepper through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aged 10 months in 25% new American oak, this pleasantly oaky wine delights with its complexity and overall balance. Pineapple, peach and citrus fruits are complemented by notes of coconut (there's that American oak) and hazelnut. Firm acids bring further citrus highlights to the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Clarissa Nagy, whose main job is making wine for Riverbench, sources grapes from the nearby Garey Ranch Vineyard for this bottling. It shows strawberry, plum blossom, beet juice, rose petals and cola on the nose. The palate is light and easy, with flavors of pencil lead, Earl Grey tea and brisk cranberry juice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Grenache makes up nearly three-quarters of this blend, with the rest Syrah and Mourvèdre. Bright raspberry, cranberry, rose hip and white pepper aromas lead to elegant yet high octane fruit flavors that taper toward the warm finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made of 100% Çalkarasi, an indigenous Turkish grape, this coral-colored wine offers a bouquet of strawberry and pomegranate. It is both full on the palate and refreshing, with flavors of strawberry, pomegranate, aniseed, lavender and a hint of smoke.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Varietal offerings are a rarity in this appellation. This one brings aromas of dill, woodspice and vanilla, with the focus on the barrel. The tart red cherry flavors are silky smooth, gliding on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Coconut, chocolate and coffee make for sweet and savory companions in this mushy, grippy and satisfying wine. Big on power and concentration, it has an underlay of brown sugar.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Subdued aromas of French oak, espresso, game and a hint of exotic spice come together in the glass. The palate delivers toast, licorice, roasted coffee bean, fleshy black cherry and oak-driven spice accompanied by fine-grained tannins. It's already rather evolved so drink sooner rather than later.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Floral and funky, this combines 47% Syrah, 42% Malbec, 10% Cabernet Franc and 1% Viognier. Medium-strength, it's a rustic, dusty wine with notes of blackberry, blueberry and a touch of dried herb.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark cherry in color, this wine features a bouquet of raspberry and chocolate with a hint of smoked meat. It is very light on the palate, and flavors of cherry, strawberry and thyme play on the tongue into the bright, clean finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This variety's signature dried- and fresh-herb aromas are on full display, with light barrel spices in the background. The palate brings lightly sweet plum and currant flavors that provide appeal.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Montepulciano, Sangiovese and a drop of Petit Verdot, this has aromas of pressed blue flower, dark-skinned berry and toast. The firm, straightforward palate offers black currant, clove and a hint of tobacco. Fine-grained tannins proved the frame work.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of scorched earth, chopped mint, menthol, dried herb and mature berry lead the nose. The robust palate offers raisin, licorice, clove and espresso alongside evident alcohol. Aggressive tannins leave an astringent, tongue-drying close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This hearty red opens with aromas of toast, coffee bean, ripe plum, leather and a dash of menthol. The warm, robust palate offers dried black cherry marinated in spirits, raisin, licorice and espresso alongside dusty tannins that dry out the finish. Showing the heat of the vintage, it's already evolved, with evident alcohol that throws it off-balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine offers aromas of clove and woodspice, with blue-fruit notes in the background. The flavors showing pleasing density and weight, shortening up on the finish.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from 68% Pinot Noir and 32% Syrah, this ethereal wine is pillowy in candied aromas of lemon and lime. Pinkish-copper in color, it's light, bright and succulent, and then finishes dry and with brevity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This soft, fruity wine is pretty much ready to drink. With its red-berry fruits and fresh acidity it has a crisp side, although its round, ripe texture is so attractive. Drink from the end of 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this red offers subdued aromas of black cherry, blue flower and baking spice. On the palate, notes of vanilla and roasted coffee bean accent black plum while firm tannins provide mouth-puckering support.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Vanilla, cherry and a crunch of barbecue chips greet the entry of this full-bodied, weighty wine that's soft in tannin. Baked plum and cinnamon make it inviting and satisfying on the palate, finishing with a zest of racy acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright and fragrant, this opens with scents of wild berry, rose and violet. The vibrant palate delivers tart cherry, blood orange, anise and chopped herb alongside supple tannins and zesty acidity. There's no complexity but it's easy drinking and thoroughly enjoyable.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made with 95% Malvasia and 5% Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of resin, dried fruit and flaky pastry. On the sweet but rather fresh palate, clover honey and pine nut accent a core of mature apricot.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A light, easy drinking but enjoyable expression of Brunello, this offers subtle aromas of blue flower, wild berry and a hint of baking spice. The medium-bodied palate shows black cherry, anise and a coffee note alongside pliant tannins. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of toasted oak, plum, menthol and crushed violet open on the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, leather, chopped sage and espresso alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink sooner rather than later.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rooty, nutty aromas of stewed fruits are almost baked out. On the palate, this rallies to show muscle and shape. Flavors of dried cherry, plum and raisin feature notes of caramel and spice. On the finish, this is mild and on cruise control. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spicy, minty aromas of dried herbs and modest red fruits are stony and dry. This is a juicy, agile Mencía with flavors of dry oak, spice, red currant and plum. A clean, clear, stony finish is light, bright and punchy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here's a spicy red that opens with aromas of clove, ground pepper, red berry and an earthy note of underbrush. The round, easygoing palate offers mature black cherry, licorice and a hint of espresso framed in polished tannins. Drink through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Chestnut honey, dried apricot and toasted almond aromas unfold in the glass and carry over to the palate along with hints of baking spice and hazelnut. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plush black cherry and berry flavors are off set by layers of bramble, herb and dark toast in this slightly savory Merlot. Showing more restraint than intensity, it's an elegant wine framed by crisp acidity a fine fringe of tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas suggesting mature plum, scorched earth, clove, menthol and a hint of iris lead the nose. The ripe, one-dimensional palate offers mature black cherry, raspberry jam and cooking spice alongside fine-grained but not very persistent tannins. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark garnet in the glass, this wine features aromas of black cherry, candle wax and freshly picked oregano. Soft tannins offer a foundation for flavors of cherry, cassis, mint, espresso bean and Mediterranean herbs. Fruit and savory notes continually make way for one another on the palate, concluding in an herbal and lemon zest finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Menthol, mature black currant, eucalyptus, espresso and clove aromas lead the nose. On the austere palate, ground pepper and licorice accent mature black cherry while assertive, close-grained tannins leave a firm finish. Drink after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Toasted nuts, seared marshmallows, roasted corn and dried apple play on the nose of this richly layered wine. The palate shows plenty of lively sea salt from front to back, along with concentrated citrus character and an apple-syrup ripeness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A slight whiff of leathery funk in the nose carries into the palate, but it does not override the rich cherry fruit. Extra details of mineral and earth bring further interest, and more bottle age may serve to lengthen the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A crisp and dry Vouvray, this still has those telltale honey flavors of delicious Chenin. It is rich and dense while also having great acidity and a tight, taut texture that will soften as the wine ages. It can be drunk now for its freshness, but it will be better from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mature berry, dark cooking spice and blue flower are some of the aromas that emerge on this firm red. On the palate, ground pepper, clove and licorice accent a black cherry core while brisk acidity provides the racy framework.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Leather, pencil shavings and cedar provide an edge to this wine. It's otherwise soft and approachable in a mix of blackberry and black cherry, a seasoning of cinnamon and clove providing a pleasant hit of spice on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of wild berry, menthol, baking spice and a balsamic note lead the nose. On the tightly wound palate, bracing tannins support raw cherry, anise, tobacco and a hint of coffee alongside firm acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hints of bramble and earth lend savory nuances to sunny yellow peach and melon flavors in this bright vivaciously crisp Kabinett. Off-dry in style, it's balanced by a stream of focused tangerine acidity leading from midpalate through a moderately long finish. Start drinking now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Concentrated rose petals, hibiscus and purple fruits meld with lava-rock aromas, all boosted by a touch of cola and smoke. Tart plum skins and Montgomery cherries play into the complex palate, which also shows turned earth and beef-jerky flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is 100% varietal, and sports interesting aromas of Provençal herbs. Peppery cranberry fruit is spicy and tart, fading through the midpalate into a lean, but lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh apple, pear and lemon flavors have a crystalline edge in this just-off-dry example of Elbling, an unusual white variety grown in the Mosel. It's zesty and spry, finishing with a delicious murmur of lime-pith bitterness. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spicy, meaty flavors like black pepper and beef broth blend with substantial fruit flavors in this medium-bodied, dry and rather sophisticated wine. It's almost a meal in itself, and well-balanced.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A dark-red color, aromas like dark chocolate, flavors recalling black cherry, and a dry rather than sweet taste make this a great wine for a special meal. It has layers of fruit, a bit of smoke, and lots of fine tannins that pile up for a rich mouthfeel and lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lychee and honeysuckle notes are concentrated and pure in this bright off-dry Gewürztraminer. It's elegantly structured, lifted by zesty tangerine acidity and hints of dusty pollen and mineral that linger on the finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend holds 59% Syrah, 24% Grenache, 13% Petite Sirah and 4% Zinfandel. Slightly reserved at first, with some patience it begins to show violets, boysenberries and sandalwood on the nose. Aromatic purple flowers arise on the sip, along with dark chocolate and black currant. But the wine is rigidly structured, remaining quite wound-up even after many hours open.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose isn't very expressive on this big, brawny wine but the chewy, full-bodied palate offers blackberry jam, raisin, licorice, chocolate and orange peel alongside smooth tannins. It still has enough fruit richness to carry off the hearty alcohol but drink sooner rather than later.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a fine rich balanced wine. It has ripe fruits that suggest black currants, blackberries and a tight, stalky, mineral element. At the same time, it's generous, full of juicy acidity to contrast with the dusty tannin layer that keeps it all together. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This gutsy blend of two-thirds Zinfandel plus Syrah and Tempranillo has a deep color, fresh spicy oak aromas, vivid fruit flavors and a lip-smacking layer of fine tannin. It should be just the thing with a grilled steak or pulled pork.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Everything is in place in this medium-bodied, smooth-textured and generously flavored wine. It has a good blend of subtle cherry, blackberry and raspberry flavors, plus hints of spice from barrel aging. Well balanced for drinking now through 2018, it's made with 63% Zinfandel, 23% Petite Sirah and 14% Syrah.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lots of dark-fruit flavor, an ultrasmooth texture and a lingering finish raise this medium-bodied and value-priced wine well above average. Black cherry and blackcurrant flavors are sprinkled with spices recalling nutmeg and cardamom.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Based on the premier cru Chardonnay vineyards of Cuis, this soft and fresh wine is beautifully balanced. It has apple freshness, a tangy texture from minerality, and a bright and fruity aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a vineyard created by Antonia Ferreira, the grande dame of the Douro, this wine is produced by one of her descendants. It is fragrant, fresh and with great fruitiness. Initially soft and rounded it also has a fine bite of acidity and a tight, mineral aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark berry, baking spice, herb, tobacco and a menthol note lead the nose along with a whiff of oak. The linear palate is still all wound up, showing more dark spice than fruit richness. Racy acidity and astringent tannins provide a firm backbone.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here is an easy-drinking, off-dry and delightfully fragrant wine to enjoy as an apéritif or with lightly spiced Asian fare. Honeysuckle and orange blossom aromatics dovetail with pear and papaya fruit flavors. It's round and appealing, with a good lift to the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, eucalyptus, mature berry and dark spice lead the nose. There's not a lot of fruit richness but the spicy palate offers licorice, black pepper and sage alongside grippy tannins that leave a firm, drying finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Named Telhas (tiles) from the Roman tiles that are still found occasionally in this vineyard, this is a rich spicy wine that comes mainly from Viognier. That gives the wine a perfumed character with touches of ginger, along with ripe apricots and a fine fresh aftertaste. Drink this wine from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Polished and fragrant, this charming red offers alluring scents of freshly picked rose, red berry, tilled soil and a whiff of aromatic herb. Vibrant acidity and supple tannins balance the bright cherry, strawberry, white pepper and anise flavors. Enjoy through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While dry in style, sumptuous black cherry and cassis notes lend a plummy feel to this Lemberger. It's an uncomplicated welcoming wine that's a bit plush in mouthfeel but invigorated by bright cranberry acidity on the finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It has been a while since we've reviewed Cuatro Pasos, but eight vintages later it's basically the same wine, which, for the price, means good value. This opens with earthy warm muddled berry aromas. The palate is flush and plump, reflective of a hot vintage, while blackberry and cassis flavors finish hefty. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fragrant and fresh, this vibrant wine offers alluring scents field flower and white stone fruit scents. The creamy palate delivers white peach, honeydew melon and citrus flavors, brightened with crisp acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blended with 9% Grenache, this is velvety-thick on the palate, with black licorice, black raspberry and a savory tone of grilled meat. Medium-bodied, it relatively restrained in the glass, not giving in to its denser, darker side.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A touch of smoke is all that appears on the nose of this tight and taut wine. Acidity and slight tannic grip provide a structure and frame its lovely, tart but dark fruit that recalls fresh blueberries tinged with peppery spice. Crunchy, classy and moreish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Grüner Veltliner's salty, yeasty savoriness comes with a tinge of sage and soy. Its slender palate, on the other hand, recalls zesty lime and lemon. Light and sprightly with spritz and verve, there is something weightless and animated here, with a lovely, savory, herbal finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The first King Estate rosé since 2008, this is as serious a wine as rosé can be. Deep in color, deep in flavor, it offers a rich mix of orange peel and orange liqueur, cherry kirsch, and a gentle citrus streak. It was produced entirely from estate-grown, biodynamic grapes.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Creamy, herbal freshness reminiscent of fern and fig leaf rises from the glass in this wine. That same combination of creaminess and verve pervades the concentrated palate. It's dry, sophisticated and wonderfully compact.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright raspberry fruit dominates here, backed with ample acidity. Give it a little breathing time and it fleshes out and lengthens. At this stage the fruit is clean and primary, but the overall structure suggests giving it another couple of years of bottle age for prime time enjoyment.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With 45% Mourvèdre and 35% Cinsault this has turned into a highly flavored and aromatic wine. It has great fruits and a rich texture that has a herbal edge. It is certainly a food rosé and with its up-front fruit, it could do with a few months to calm down. Drink from late 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh blueberry and plum play on nose and palate. Lively freshness permeates the glass, accentuating the wine's tart, precise fruitiness. It's medium bodied with moderate grip, lots of verve and a nervy, fresh and totally appetizing finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A screaming deal from Dan Lee and company, this dynamic Syrah shows plush blackberry, vanilla and caramel aromas. There's buoyant red and purple fruit on the palate, from boysenberry to black raspberry, kept fresh with lively acidity and accented with lavender and thyme.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The spicy, generous and almost floral aromas of new oak envelope this wine's ripe, red cherry fruit. The palate is smooth, rich and laced with cinnamon yet balanced by inherent freshness. Elegant now, it will taste better with a little bottle age, when the tannins are smooth. Drink 2019–2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the vineyard owned by winemaker Bill Brosseau's family, this bottling shows black raspberry, strawberry, wet slate and rose petal scents on the nose. The palate is loaded with earthy black plum and other dark fruits, lifted by a star anise spiciness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is bursting with ripe luscious fruits, a generous assortment of pear, tangerine, apricot and more. It's a big full-bodied and juicy delight, ready right now. Drink up!\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This rounded Chardonnay from winemaker Duncan Williams (also of Falkner in Temecula) shows creamy cherimoya and nectarine fruit, accented with cinnamon, clove and butter on the nose. The palate is delicate and supple, its salted almond and nectarine flavors riding a wave of vibrant acidity into the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Initial charred aromas yield to aggressive cherry and maple scents. This is a wide, fully tannic load of a Malbec with toasty flavors of burnt wheat bread and maple to go with blackberry and cassis. Toast remains on the finish, which also tastes of licorice. Drink through 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a high-elevation, steeply sloped site, this lovely, balanced wine offers a wealth of white pepper, garrigue and blueberry aromas, hitting all the marks of cool-climate character. Dense and smooth, it reveals smoke and game elements as it unwinds toward the spicy finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blackberry, brandied cherry and spice aromas lead to a wide palate with tannins that pierce like nails. This tastes a touch foxy and wild, while the finish feels centered and firm. Despite intense, abrasive tannins, this displays depth and complexity. Drink through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bottling from a winery whose owners are originally from Brittany shows peppery spice, tart red fruit, rose petal and lava rock scents on the nose. The flavors range widely from white pepper and dill to fresh-pressed strawberry and red plum, with a slight hint of caramel. Varietally pure and very fresh.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Alluring smature orchard fruit, grilled herb, toasted nut and flint scents take center stage in this savory white, accented by a balsamic note. The round, creamy, palate mirrors the nose, offering juicy white peach, baked apple and celery flavors. A blast of candied tangerine closes the lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Although the challenging vintage resulted in just a half-ton per acre of Chardonnay in this dry appellation (a third of its normal yield), this wine is fantastic. Flinty and smoky aromas lead to Gala apple, white peach and lemon peel on the nose, while the palate combines salt, grapefruit pith and seared apple flavors. A sharp line of acidity brings it all into balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pressed yellow flower, flint and Mediterranean herb aromas fuse with citrus zest and a balsamic note. The round, savory palate doles out ripe apricot, creamy pear and juicy nectarine flavors, tangy acidity carrying a bitter almond tone long into the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich and creamy poached pear, banana and coconut aromas show in a ripe but not overdone way in this blend of 46% Roussanne, 37% Marsanne and 17% Viognier. There is a strong textural grip to the palate, focusing its apple, cherimoya and lemon peel flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Edgy berry aromas include notes of pencil lead and woody oak. The crisp bouncy acidic palate emphasizes freshness over weight. Plum, currant and oak-based flavors are spicy and snappy, while this maintains a spicy character on a dry finish. Drink through 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is a steal for its quality—well-rounded, expressive and complemented with additions of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Syrah and Merlot. Cherry and vanilla flavors predominate, accented with cedar and tobacco, the texture remaining soft and smooth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Veteran Kevin Judd has turned out another fine effort. Passion fruit and pea tendril aromas impart a welcome green edge that's never overwhelming, picking up layers of white grapefruit on the plump, medium-bodied palate. The finish is intense, long and citrusy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This richly dense and full-bodied wine from a famous site offers grippy tannin and toasted oak, complementing spicy fruit highlights of dark cherry accented with vanilla.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soft, billowy tannins buoy this wine's dense red fruit, accented with dried herb, cedar and pencil shaving flavors. Ripe and full bodied, its oak is integrated and quiet.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Baked berry and cherry aromas are ripe and come with accents of mocha, leather and caramel. This feels full but not heavy, with balance and cushion to the palate. Spiced black-fruit flavors show a tea-like note, while this is dry, spicy and a touch chocolaty on the finish. Drink through 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bold strokes of blackberry, cassis and bramble persist throughout this surprisingly youthful late-release Cabernet Sauvignon. It's rich on the palate yet balanced neatly, boasting brisk acidity and ripe but grippy tannins. Two years of maturation in French oak contribute to a long finish marked with sweet tobacco and baking spices.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright, compressed fruit stars in this approachable and affordable Pinot Noir that's rounded with tannin and focused acidity. Cranberry, orange, cherry and cola flavors highlight its medium-bodied power and concentration.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While lemony-fresh with a streak of crushed-stone minerality, this medium-bodied white lacks the exuberance and spice expected of Gewürztraminer. It's refreshing and pleasing nonetheless, with a spray of lingering white blossom perfume on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Berry and cassis aromas turn more saucy with airing. This has a sticky mouthfeel with protruding acids, while flavors of plum and citrus finish short. This is good if you're looking for the basics.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Whiffs of clay and fallen leaves lend an earthy tone to this ripe, rich wine. The palate is lush, almost pulpy, with black cherry and plum flavors but brisk acidity and grippy tannins finish taut and tight.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine suggests green, savory herbs along with cherry and currant. It's elegant in style, velvety in feel, and delivers good concentration to the fruit flavors plus barrel notes (20% new French) on the lingering finish. The variety gets lost with the herbal notes taking over, but it still offers enjoyment.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Firm, dry tannins behind this wine give a hard edge that will need time. The wine is powered by its structure, solid and only just fruity. Wait until at least 2017 to allow more fruitiness to come through, although the wine will likely always be tough.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Half fermented in oak with the rest in stainless steel, this wine offers lees, butter and vanilla, with a dry, medium-bodied feel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This round, sticky blend smells burnt and like underbrush, and is very woody, with milk chocolate and plastic aromas. Thick and sticky on the palate, with lactic oak, sweet spice, carob and berry flavors, this is dominated by creamy oak and generic fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Stalky aromas suggest weedy underbrush and celery, with whiffs of salted appetizers and sweat. The meaty, impenetrable palate delivers rubber, mocha, and a confectionary note alongside chewy tannins and searing alcohol.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Herbaceous, crisp and fruity, this fresh wine has citrus, juicy apple and a hint of yellow fruits as well as bright acidity. It's totally ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Jammy plum and currant aromas are light on complexity. This blend is crisp, fresh and ultimately modest in feel, with black cherry and plum flavors. A clean finish makes it good for everyday drinking.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lightly herbal aromas and a touch of animal blend with oak-based notes of sweet plastic and vanilla on the nose. The palate is round but slightly flabby, with moderate acidity. Lactic oak creates a plastic-like flavor that is derivative of the nose, while the finish is drab.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This tightly stalky wine offers fresh red fruits and aromatic acidity. With tannins right up front, it is still young and needing to develop. The wine's name comes from the shirt numbers of the two French rugby players who feature on the label. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pressed apple and pear notes are accented with penetrating layers of smoke, nuts and clove on this full-bodied Chardonnay. Tart lemon acidity lends freshness to the midpalate and into a spry finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A tribute to the year—1935—of the founding of the Monségur cooperative, this wine has structure, dry tannins and ripe, plummy fruits. It's firm, showing fresher black currant flavors and acidity at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This stalky wine shows wood aging as much as fruit. Toast and some bitter extraction are contrasted with tight black currant fruits. It will soften and turn into an approachable fruity wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh and fruity, this wine is already developing attractively. The wood aging gives some toasty character although the black currant fruitiness makes the wine accessible and bright. Drink from late 2015.\n",

      "This structured, firm wine lives up to the fortifications at its namesake château. It's a dark wine, not quite ripe with some green fruit flavors. Acidity and dry tannins are very present and need to soften. Let it wait and drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of spiced plum and exotic spice lead the nose on this robust wine. On the palate, scorching alcohol overwhelms dried black cherry and licorice, throwing the wine completely off balance. Astringent tannins and a green note of powdered sage create an extremely bitter finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plump melon and stone fruit aromas are a touch broken down and mealy. This Godello feels fleshy and round, with pulpy weight. Tangerine and tropical fruit flavors weigh in on the heavy side, while the finish is chunky and pithy in flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a reductive funk at first on the nose, with singed rubber and creosote, but that quickly gives way to cherry, boysenberry and brown spices. Flavors are dominated by tart cherry and cedar, with hints of slate-driven, earthy minerals.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of six different varieties with Chardonnay (35%) and Marsanne (19%) taking the lead, this medium-sweet wine suggests tangerine, sweet corn and crème fraîche, with some of the aromas and flavors seeming to tussle.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fragrant layers of cinnamon, toast and vanilla adorn this intensely ripe, fleshy red wine. Blackberry and plum flavors are ruddy on the palate, but brightened by a zip of acidity and fine, chalky tannins on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "For the first release of this wine, the oak unfortunately is almost completely overwhelming. Vanilla, green wood, mocha and mint overpower almost any sense of varietal aroma and flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full in flavor and body, this sturdy wine based on Viognier, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Gris with a dash of Chardonnay has crisp acidity to keep it lively. It smells like pears and honeydew melon and tastes dry but generous and a little buttery, and finishes clean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Despite the label indication that this wine is Sauvignon Blanc, it does in fact have 20% Sémillon. That addition fills out the wine while retaining the natural herbaceous character with its grassy texture and strongly citrus flavors. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine offers notes of black olive, sweet plum, confection and herbs. The flavors are lighter in style with gritty tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy, syrupy aromas come with a spot of green and a touch of earthy mulch. This is bulky and flabby in feel as it struggles for balance. Thick berry flavors are matched by green, herbal, mossy notes, while the finish is chewy in feel and baked in flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blends nutty notes with aromas of chemical and saline. The palate is tight, sharp and citric, while flavors of briny apricot come with bitter as well as nutty notes. A dry, salty finish feels angular and sharp.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crafted from a field blend of varieties, including Carignan, Syrah and Durif, this holds a syrupy sense of meaty bacon and plum raisin at its center. Midweight and fairly straightforward in terms of flavor, it finishes fast and not overly complex.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light in color, this suggests berry, herbs and wood. It's airy in feel with tart cranberry-juice flavors and a puckering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Woody aromas of sawdust and maple take over a lightly herbal bouquet. Plum, raspberry and chocolaty oak flavors finish herbal and resiny.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a bargain-priced blend of Grenache, Syrah, Carignan, Mourvèdre and Cinsault. The flavors are ripe and plummy, accented by hints of garrigue, while the tannins are modest and supple.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The varieties in the blend include Grenache Blanc, Roussanne and Viognier. They come together to offer hints of pineapple, pear and citrus. There's a silky texture on the palate, then a clean, crisp finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plush, ripe apple and apricots are dusted in savory, earthy notes of slate and spice. It's a dancing, delicately framed wine with a balance of soft, sweet fruit and zesty acidity. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Drink this maturing wine over the next year or two. Leather, chocolate and cherry notes mingle easily, the texture is smooth and the finish is silky.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Muskateller is a powerhouse Muscat grape, chock full of buoyant stone fruit, melon and floral aromas. It's an unabashedly fruity, flamboyantly forward grape, but this off-dry example is brisk and balanced.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of Spanish broom, honeysuckle and a yeasty note lead the nose of this Sicilian sparkler from Mount Etna. The palate offers ripe apple, candied citrus and bitter walnuts alongside persistent bubbles and zesty acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Because of the cool Atlantic climate, the Gascogne region is home to many bright, crisp wines. This is fruity, fresh and utterly crisp while also having some hints of melon and peach flavors. A touch of attractive minerality gives the wine texture. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe, oaky and showing aromas of coconut, vanilla, raisin and prune, this easily approachable Monastrell is full, dark and stretched wide, with proper acidity keeping things fenced in and focused. Sun-baked black-fruit flavors finish spicy and peppery, with mild heat.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pear, melon and anise aromas lead the way, followed on the palate by a broad, soft mouthfeel and flavors that add peppery spice on the long finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This creamy feeling wine is dry and spicy on the nose more than bold and fruity. Candied cherry, raspberry and milk chocolate flavors carry mild spice accents, while the finish is lightly oaked in flavor and a touch chewy in texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Baked plum, brick dust, stewed tomato and leather aromas are rugged but good. Chewy and only moderately tannic, this basic Monastrell delivers raspberry and plum flavors sweetened by hints of brown sugar and molasses. A lasting, chocolaty finish is easygoing, with a shot of acidity for balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very perfumed with wood and strong berry flavors, this stalky, structured wine has tannins that are already well integrated into the spicy, juicy red fruits. Bold flavors and tasty fruitiness are well balanced with the texture and dry core. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Supple in juicy blackberry and plum, this light- to medium-bodied Merlot contains 10% Cabernet Franc and offers a mouthful of dry, dusty tannins before finishing in a punch of black peppery spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aged in new barriques, this opens with aromas of oak and oak-driven spices and a whiff of savory herbs. The palate is dominated by oak, vanilla and coffee that muffle the dried dark-cherry and mineral flavors. It has a linear quality but lacks fruit richness and is still in the vice-like grip of wood tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Piercing lemon and lime notes are offset by juicy peach and pear flavors in this fresh, easy-drinking Riesling. Off dry in style, it's fruity and forward, with a crisp, refreshing finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the owner of Domaine du Pégau in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this is a négociant-style Côtes du Rhône. It's medium-bodied and crisp, with bright red fruit reminiscent of raspberries and cherries and a touch of herbes de Provence.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rubber, menthol, black olive and dusty oak aromas dominate the nose on this stable Carmenère. Olive, blackberry and herbal flavors are typical of the variety, while the finish is clean, powerful and in good shape.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with earthy, smoky aromas of coffee grinds and blackberry along with toasted marshmallow. The palate is thick and mouthfilling, with baked berry, spice and chocolate flavors. The finish is minty and herbal, with moderate heat and burn.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A brick color on the rim agrees with very tasty and mature flavors to indicate this wine should be enjoyed now. It smells like dried leaves on the forest floor, and tastes rather beefy and savory in flavor with hints of Worcestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar. It is medium to full bodied and smooth in texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light colored and fruity, this has the typical Négrette polish, aromas and dry tannins accompanied by red berry fruits, with a richer, full aftertaste. The wine is made to drink young, so drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine has firm tannins certainly. However its main character is the delicious, juicy fruit that just bursts out of the glass. A fresh character suggests this wine will develop quickly, despite the tannic background. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sourced from a range of vineyards across the Napa Valley, including Atlas Peak, Rutherford and Oakville, this intense wine is informed by thick-grained tannins and pronounced oak. Dark blackberry fruit and clove season it well, along with a finish steep in mocha. The blend includes a small amount of Merlot.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Black plum, violet and baking spice aromas emerge in the glass. The soft palate offers blueberry, blackberry, grilled herb and white pepper alongside sleek tannins. It's smooth and accessible so enjoy soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh black fruits give this wine a bright start in life. It is rich with some tannins and dark spice. Dominant berry-fruit flavors are balanced with acidity and a dry, firm aftertaste. Drink from the end of 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese, this has a subdued nose that doesn't give much away. The palate offers dried black cherries, blackberry extract, vanilla, licorice and new oak but the fruit is drying up quickly, leaving an abrupt, astringent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This fresh blend of Négrette with both Cabernets is fruity and lightly crisp with refreshing final acidity. It's bright, while also having a ripe character that allows it to broaden out. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A mineral layering of waxy pear gives this wine a light, crisp complexion, punctuated by subtle, oaky spice and plenty of vibrant lemon. Light on the palate, it'll serve well for larger gatherings.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Baked strawberry and a bittersweet note of cherry play off the palate around a medium-bodied frame of subtle tannin and oak. Dried cranberry comes in as a secondary detail, before the wine finishes in a blaze of leather and black tea.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A freshly textured wine that has a bite of spice to contrast with its tangy lemon acidity. It's fresh, fruity and ready to drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc starts with aromas of black fruit, earth, cedar wood and exotic spices. The densely concentrated, one-dimensional palate delivers fleshy black cherry accented with black pepper and licorice alongside round tannins. It's already accessible so enjoy soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big, hard tannins and high alcohol mark this Zinfandel. Bone dry, it's stuffed with blackberry jam, sage and black pepper flavors that finish spicy and long. It's an excellent example of the Maple Vineyard terroir, and calls for pairing with rich barbecue and fatty fare.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This full-bodied white leads with typical varietal aromas that recall white roses, lychee and spice.

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a fine introduction to an outstanding Oregon Pinot Noir vintage. Forward and instantly accessible, it plays off pretty cherry fruit flavors and aromatics. Tannins are fully ripe and the acidity has kept pace.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full and rich, this wine brings out smooth apple and pear flavors that are sustained by hints of wood aging. It has a fresher side with citrus acidity giving the rounder textures a lift. Worth aging, it can be drunk from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There was no oak used on this stainless steel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc, but it does contain a splash of Viognier. It's dry, crisp in acidity and savory in lime, orange, kumquat and vanilla flavors that finish long and clean. It will pair with everything from bruschetta with olive tapenade to fried chicken, Chinese food and sushi. Easy to find, with 190,000 cases produced.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoky, herbal aromas add complexity to pretty floral notes on this elegantly composed semisweet Riesling. The palate is rich with peach and nectarine flavors, along with a shock of citrus acidity, but maintains a subtle line of smoky, dusty earthiness through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a hint of sweetness here, but the rich flavors of strawberry nougat, along with a creamy texture, carry it beautifully. A lick of vanilla comes through in the finish. Drink it solo or with a spicy cold noodle salad.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With classic raspberry, cherry and sandalwood flavors, wrapped into a delicately crisp mouthfeel, this is a classic Russian River Pinot for drinking now. Everything about it suggests beef, whether it's in a taco or a full-fledged steak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smooth, rich, wood-aged Chardonnay dominates this ripe, complex blend. Soft and rounded, it provides the yellow fruit flavors and toastiness. The Arinto in the blend supplies the freshness. Together, they make wine a for aging. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The magnificent Tomar convent complex was once home to the Knights Templar. This wine, with its firm tannins and dense fruit, brings out the structure of Touriga Nacional and Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Spice, wood aging and rich berry fruits all promise medium-term aging. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With aromas of wood aging, this is a tropical fruit and spice flavored wine. It displays a strong sense of texture and freshness. It is already showing richness as well as a good sense of style. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Great streaks of acidity cut across the ripe fruit. The wine has touches of toast from the 20% wood aging, along with a steely, more mineral character. These combine well with the peach and ripe apple flavors. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This elegant wine opens with fragrances of white flowers and green apple. The silky palate offers ripe pear, Golden Delicious apple and mineral alongside crisp acidity that leaves a clean, bright finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here is a gentle, evocative Pinot Noir, with a pretty, almost delicate mix of flavors. Raspberry, black cherry, dried leaves and black olive swirl together, with a lick of chocolate in the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Pinot's parts haven't found each other yet. There's big, ripe raspberry and cherry fruit, sweet, toasty oak, brisk acids and firm tannins, yet they form an unruly confederation. Stash this in the cellar until at least 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A well-balanced Pinot Bianco, it has subdued aromas of apples and freshly cut flowers. The palate delvers creamy white peach and Golden Delicious apple alongside crisp acidity. Pair this with fried calamari or pasta topped with clams and mussels.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made entirely with Sangiovese, it has aromas of ripe black fruit, tilled earth, toasted oak sweet vanilla and a hint of leather. The rich palate offers toasted oak, black berries, espresso and coffee alongside dusty, drying tannins\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Laden with wood aromas, this is a firm, dry wine. The fruit can cope with the considerable wood flavors, suggesting a wine that will be smooth, rich and velvety. It has weight now, but needs to age. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The acidity is strong and the cherry, herb tea and white pepper flavors are elegant. It grows on you as you sip, showing more and more complexity. It's a fine wine for drinking now with Pinot-friendly fare, such as roast lamb or a wild mushroom risotto with grated cheese.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Whiffs of smoke and grain lend a savory bent to lemon and herb aromas on this full bodied, dry Riesling. Searing lemon-lime acidity and a minerally palate contribute to its lean, linear style.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Juslyn's wines are made in a tannic style. The suggestion here is ageabiity. This bottle, which is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon but also contains Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, is not drinkable now, unless you're immune to astringency. It's future is uncertain, but you might try aging it until 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lots of rich, ripe raspberry and cherry jam fruit in this dry, briskly acidic Pinot Noir. Oak shows up in the form of buttered cinnamon toast. It's a little irregular in tannins, but delicious for drinking now, after decanting.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a chunkier, somewhat rustic cousin to Pinot Noir, often used to bulk up a sparkling wine. Here, on its own, it's generously loaded with pomegranate, earth and green tea flavors. The aromatics capture some of the rose petal bouquet of its more delicate relation.\n",

      "Here the fruit seems to stay in the watermelon/strawberry range, not under-ripe, but more in a high-acid, Euro style. The oak aging (18 months) cloaks it in a lush coat of milk chocolate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Kirsten's 2014 Rieslings each share a core of minerality that prevails over primary fruit, but this dry bottling is particularly savory in style. It's refreshingly spry with layers of smoke and chalk notes meandering amidst sheer streaks of fresh, white grapefruit and apple. The finish is brisk and clean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fragrant white flower and ripe orchard fruit aromas take center stage. The fresh palate offers mature yellow apple, pineapple, aromatic herb and a light toasted note while a hint of oak-driven spice accents the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose is non-distinct but the palate follows with fresh, bright apple and tart greengage fruit. The palate is willowy, subtle and winning.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aroma recalls ripe, juicy pear peel. Likewise, the palate sings with ripe pear notes, framed by a phenolic texture and countered by lively freshness. This wine is brisk, clean and fruity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of melon, fennel, hay and tomato vine float out of the glass. The crisp, creamy palate offers white peach, lemon and Mediterranean herb alongside fresh acidity. A mineral note energizes the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This dark, very ripe Crianza smells extracted, jammy and slightly soupy, with aromas of raisin, pipe tobacco and blackberry. The palate is heavy and a touch hollow, with baked berry, vanilla, licorice and resiny flavors. An oak-based finish tastes ripe, succulent and like mocha.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Extremely ripe fruit flavors fuel this full-bodied, no-holds barred wine. The aromas are like blackberry jam and raspberry syrup, and the flavors are almost that extreme, but the wine is technically dry. A very viscous texture wraps it up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Coming from one of the region's more picturesque vineyards, this bottling, which is enhanced with 19% Picpoul Blanc, 2% Roussanne and 2% Viognier, leans a tad tropical on the nose, with orange peel cutting into banana, apple custard and tuberose. There's sizzling acidity throughout the palate, with flavors of lemon curd, apple peel and grapefruit pith.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big, powerful and confidently ripe, this full-bodied wine oozes with luscious blackberry, wild sage and blueberry flavors that seemingly melt in the mouth. A great example of the late harvest style without being sweet, it's dry, concentrated and persistent on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Forest floor, truffle, new leather, ripe berry and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find in this delicious red. The fresh, chewy palate doles out fleshy black cherry, chopped mint and white pepper notes, while big, round tannins provide structure. It's already enjoyable but will offer years of fine drinking. Enjoy 2018–2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Truffle, leather, mature black-skinned fruit and carob aromas emerge from this powerful red. The full-bodied palate delivers succulent wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice, pipe tobacco and grilled herb flavors with big, chewy tannins. Drink 2019–2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A touch of flinty reduction clings to the nose but soon relaxes into soft notes of ripe black cherry. The palate is textured and dry, harmonious with fruit and the gentle ripple and crunch of slightly rustic but utterly pleasant tannins. This seems to be its perfect drinking window now: generous with fruit, utterly harmonious and starting to mellow. The finish is fresh, clean and totally moreish. If you can resist at all, this may well continue to develop. Drink now through 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of barrels selected from several sites, this is a plush, easy-to-love wine. It's shy on the nose at first, just hinting at wild strawberry and herbal aromas. Soft, with a touch of bitter black tea it fades into a slow finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Seared lemon, hazelnut, brown butter and sandalwood with a graphite minerality come through on the nose of this complex wine from Jonathan Nagy. The palate offers hints of herbs and chamomile at first, then washes of citrusy acidity and apple notes, all held together with steely tension.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh blackberry and boysenberry aromas meld with rose petal and hickory smoke on the warm entry of this bottling from Jonathan Nagy. The palate is packed with peppery spice, bright red cherry, thyme and root beer flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Named for the special format of small oak barrel it's aged in, this has soaked up the oak impressively. Hints of vanilla and graham crackers accent mixed berry fruit, while the finish is long and mouthwatering. There's ample concentration, yet the wine never seems heavy. Drinkable now, but why rush things? Drink 2020–2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This purple-tinted Carignan is a concentrated number with familiar varietal and regional aromas of latex, graphite, schist, tire rubber and black fruits. In the mouth, this is chewy and full bodied, but not heavy. Oaky spicy blackberry and nutmeg flavors linger on a mildly woody, extracted and gritty finish. Best to give this a few more years so drink through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An outstanding effort in a difficult vintage, these old vines (the oldest were planted in 1889) have turned out a super wine. Complex aromas and flavors range from smoke, thyme blossom and licorice to apricots and black cherries. this is medium to full in body, with crisp acids and supple tannins that impart a silky feel to the long finish. Drink now–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "One of the plusses to having a cash-flow brand like Yellow Tail in the portfolio is that it gives the owners the opportunity to properly age their high-end wines prior to release. At 10 years old, this has acquired a veneer of silkiness and elegance that enfolds the cassis and red-currant fruit. There's no shortage of smoky, vanilla and brown-sugar inflected oak either. Drink now–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Owned by art collector Philippe Raoux, who has filled the park of the chateau with impressive sculptures, this estate produces serious and complex wines. This latest release continues in that tradition. It is rich, structured and full of swathes of black fruit. The wine will take time, so wait until 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a structured wine that still has serious layers of ripe fruit and rich tannins. The black currant from the Cabernet Sauvignon is balanced by the jammy richness of the delicious Merlot. It's an impressive wine that continues the progress of this estate, owned by Lafite-Rothschild. Drink from 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This second wine of whites from both Haut-Brion and La Mission Haut-Brion is both rich and intensely crisp. It has a fine blend between great acidity and grapefruit fruit and a more tropical element. The tangy texture is taut with a mineral edge. Drink from 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Under the ownership of Jacky Lorenzetti, president of one of France's top rugby clubs, this estate is now performing impressively. The wine is finely structured with dark tannins and tight acidity and a hint of minerality. It is Merlot dominated, although it is the 40% Cabernet Sauvignon that brings out the black-currant fruitiness. Drink from 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wild berry, dark spice and Mediterranean herb aromas lift out of the glass, accented by a whiff of new leather. The enveloping, full-bodied palate doles out fleshy black cherry, star anise, pipe tobacco and cinnamon notes, framed by chewy tannins. Drink 2020–2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Apricot compote and candied peach shine on nose and palate with great intensity. The overtly floral notes of rose have given way to a more subtle perfume that highlights the aromas of peach above all. This is very concentrated, very rich, but also precise and fresh. It is citrus tanginess that allows this to be sweet yet still refreshing. Medium to sweet finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This stellar bottling offers chaparral character on the nose, from wild mint and thyme to fennel and mountain tea, along with turned earth and raspberry scents. The plate kicks off with strawberry fruit and hibiscus, then dives into a deeper expression of grippy black plum skins, cardamom spice and boisterous acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy and dark fruit-driven, this is a richly rewarding, fruity wine, ripe in blackberry, clove and cocoa. From an estate vineyard named for Benovia proprietor's two mothers, Martha and Eleanor, it offers the appellation's classic elements of savory clove and cola.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a richly satisfying wine with beautiful Granny Smith apple and honeyed caramel flavors. Fennel and wildflower accents add to its complexity, broadened by nutmeg spice. It's full bodied and balanced, delivering both ripeness and structure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Great fruit concentration and grace make this wine a winner. It feels medium-bodied despite its high degree of ripeness, showing that balance is attainable with significant power. It has ripe, plummy aromas, fresh red cherry and cranberry flavors, supportive tannins and excellent acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This second wine of Château Palmer is dense and structured. With ripe swathes of black fruits and juicy Merlot showing strongly, it already displays the potential of the vintage. Generous and ripe, the wine has a fine level of perfumed tannin. Drink from 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is something floral and tender, even creamy on the nose. The palate on the one side has a creamy apricot and peach aspect, on the other a totally taut and brisk lemon-lime streak. This makes for tension and interest. This is concentrated and exciting, dry and very, very enjoyable. Drink now through 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tender notes of honeysuckle and rose rise from the glass. On the palate they perfume the generous peach and mirabelle plum fruit, supported by some residual sweetness. This strikes a very harmonious balance between tender opulence an sprightly freshness. The finish is intense, tangy, medium sweet and superbly balanced.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Chopped herb, wild berry, spice and truffle aromas slowly take shape in the glass. The palate shows both concentration and elegance, offering fleshy raspberry, crushed cherry, licorice and crushed mint flavors, bolstered by firm but refined tannins. Drink 2019–2027.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Chive and onion skin aromas blend with hints of mint, marcona almond and vanilla on the nose of this bottling from winemaker Bruce McGuire. From one of Pierre Lafond's special sites, it has a savory palate that recalls salted peanuts, seared lemon and popcorn on the finish. Lemony acidity cuts through it all.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose is a very enticing mix of rose petal and peach, grapefruit zest and musky spice. The palate echoes the same flavors and is both intense and concentrated. There is residual sweetness making all the fruit flavors luscious and plump, countered by sprightly fresh acidity that results in an over all medium-sweet wine. The flavors are precise and clean and so is the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Garden herb and forest floor aromas make a case for this wine to be considered the producer's “Finest Selection” (the “FS” in “OFS”). On the palate, wild strawberry, black cherry and berry are the story, while powerful spice adds intrigue to the velvety texture, roundness and full-bodied concentration.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Richly textured and generously flavored, this wine shows how good Livermore Cabernet can be. Aged in new Hungarian barrels, it has cedar and spice aromas, seductive ripe fruit flavors and a mouth-filling, palate-soothing viscosity bolstered by loads of fine-grained tannins. Best from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This resplendent white offers a wealth of wet stone minerality and crisp, lemony acidity, with just a subtle hint of oak. From old vines, it boasts tangerine and anise flavors on the palate, with tropical notes of guava and mango and a jolt of nuttiness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Chardonnay breaks away from the typical varietal profile, with aromas of freshly cut grass and lemongrass. Delightful tropical fruit flavors of mango, lychee and guava dominate the palate. The zesty, clean and crisp finish is characterized by flavors of lemon pith and lime juice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Menthol, crushed flower, red raspberry and savory herb aromas unfold in the glass. The palate conveys juicy red cherry, white pepper and cinnamon alongside supple tannins. It's surprisingly accessible for such a young Barolo. Drink 2016–2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas recall fennel, grilled herb, leather, mocha and a whiff of balsam. Reflecting the heat of the vintage, the palate is already evolved but still shows dried black cherry and black pepper. Drink through 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This highly accessible, reasonably priced Chardonnay sees no new oak. It offers aromatics of orange blossom and fresh-squeezed lemon followed by a lean texture of more lemon, honeysuckle and melon. Stock up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A delightful bottle with notes of stone fruit, buttered popcorn and toasty spice. It's light in style, displaying both nuance and delicacy, with enough acidity to keep it all in vivid focus.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Leather, truffle, black cherry, grilled herb and a whiff of mocha lead the nose on this structured but straightforward wine. The palate is still rather closed but delivers crushed red cherry, white pepper and grilled herb alongside fresh acidity and young, raspy tannins that need time to soften. Drink 2018–2028.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This starts with aromas of rose, crushed violet, red berry and mint. The palate delivers red and black cherry accented with notes of cocoa and mocha alongside youthfully assertive tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the first whiff of cherry, cranberry and caramel you know you are in for a treat. Flavors of clove, marzipan and grilled peach add nuance to the red fruit driven palate. The smooth tannins persist without overpowering the bright fruit and spice tones.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a classic producer who continues to do the variety justice, this Merlot is complex and concentrated. A taste of bright red plum and berry fruit intermingles with toasty oak and supple vanilla. The tannins are soft and a playful hint of herb marks the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is still a young wine, with its ripe red fruits and black cherry flavors. The taste of licorice mingles with the fruit and balances with the smoky toast flavors. It's a rich wine that needs time, so drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Vanilla and lemon curd aromas bring nuance and depth to the the complex bouquet of this wine. Full bodied with a silky texture, tones of green apple and mango show bright on the palate, leading to a splash of minerality on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a powerful and ripe wine that is full of tannins that are now mature enough to support the broad, ripe black-fruite character. A blend of Aragonez, Alicante Bouschet and Tinta Calada, it has a dense structure, with a full-bodied juicy aftertaste. Drink now, but the wine will be better after 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of this brawny wine suggest black plum, berry, violet, leather and dill. Notes of licorice, tobacco and black pepper back up the sour cherry fruit. Big with round tannins, this is just reaching its ideal drinking window. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Jammy blackberry, rubber, graphite and raw oak aromas set up a full, weighty palate. Flavors of mint, licorice, creamy oak and chocolate accent brambly black-fruit flavors, while a minty finish simmers with power and subtle warmth. Drink through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% Merlot is juicy in black cherry and plum flavors, followed by outbursts of dusty tannin that provide just enough grip. The savory cinnamon and clove aspects are backed by toasty oak, a silky texture and plenty of acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from 68-year-old Nerello Mascalese vines and aged in terra-cotta amphorae, this ripe and powerful wine offers aromas of leather, tilled earth, game, truffle and black berry fruit. The juicy palate delivers mouthfuls of black cherry accented with clove and cinnamon alongside round, velvety tannins and the warmth of alcohol.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the well-known Zinfandel producer, this floral Chardonnay is high in balanced minerality and marked by darker, riper pear and apple fruit. The finish is swathed in vanilla bean and toast.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Black olive dominates on the nose in this blend of 75% Syrah, 12.5% Grenache and 12.5% Mourvèdre, all from Kick Ranch. Lively red fruit is amplified by soft, medium-bodied tannins and a well-composed finish, with just enough earth and spice to go around.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rose petal, leather, wet soil, truffle and red berry aromas lead the nose and follow through to the ripe palate along with cherry-berry, white pepper and mint. It's delicious and already surprisingly accessible. Drink 2016–2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The bouquet of this wine shows condensed fruit notes of green apple and lemon pith, with a slight nuance of vanilla on the nose. Full bodied and creamy on the palate, it exhibits balanced acidity on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine has been heavily extracted, giving an initial bitter coffee and a dry tannic character. The fruit weight will compensate for this, bringing out acidity, black plums and rich berries. It has the right concentration to age, so drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The vineyard for this 100% Grenache is certified sustainable, organic and Biodynamic. Bright and light in strawberry and mint, the wine has a strong herbal component intertwined with tartness and tingling acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Still young, but promising good things, this is a ripe and balanced wine. It's a blend of grapes from two Douro vineyards (Duas Quintas), giving black fruits, a strong sense of minerality and a dark texture. The end promises aging and drinkability from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fruit is sourced from Bismark Vineyard in the Moon Mountain District. Compared with the winery's Winemaker's Cuvée, this combines Cabernet Sauvignon (83%) with a larger percentage of Malbec (17%). It spends the same amount of time—two years—in French oak, but slightly less of it is new. The flavors are more approachable, still dark, massive and spicy, the taste of oak slightly sweet.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Significantly full and expansive in vanilla, lemon curd and toasty oak, the Durell Vineyard shows its power here, generous in ripe flavors and rich earth. Aged just under a year in a majority of new French oak, it's built to age through 2025 or more.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Naturally low yields in a parcel within the Holder vineyard give concentration and great depth of flavor. The wine is still dominated by acidity, tense texture and a strongly steely character. Dry, nervy, needing to age, the wine has potential. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy aromas of fresh tarragon and burnt cedar make an intriguing start to this wine, whose soft opening on the palate veers quickly into heavy flavors of chopped oregano. A plum element emerges faintly on the midpalate, but this is a solid wine for herb lovers.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Showing Nebbiolo's youthful energy and refinement, this full-bodied but easy-drinking wine features aromas of red rose, violet, red berry and a whiff of baking spice. The palate doles out succulent cherry-berry and cinnamon alongside silky, supple tannins. Drink through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Whiffs of orange blossom and lemon rind lend vibrancy to this rich, luxuriously textured Pinot Gris. Just off dry in style, it bursts with flavors of white peach showered in grapefruit acidity. Luscious and irresistibly clingy, it lingers long on the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Deliciously aromatic, this is an assertive, fruit-forward wine, with textured minerality. It has yellow fruits that are cut with citrus as well as bright acidity. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Expressive, not expensive, this has an appetizing mixture of spice, herb and smoke aromas, plenty of blackberry and raspberry flavors, and a soothing texture. It smells like black pepper, dried thyme and wood smoke, then turns more fruity in the mouth. It is medium bodied and slightly soft in balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Almost as light in color as water, this is a straight-ahead take on the grape, with tropical-leaning aromas of honeysuckle, ripe papaya and boisterous passionfruit. The palate is much grassier in style, showing cut lawn, kiwi, green pears and kaffir limes, with just a touch of lingering tropical sweetness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Structured from the start, this wine provides succulent boysenberry and blackberry around a full-figured body that's otherwise steeped in vanilla and coffee, the toasted oak quite prevalent. It finishes slightly tart in dried herb and mushroom.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Grassy aromas blend with notes of melon on a round, slightly flat bouquet. This is chunky in feel, with briny citrus flavors and a lively core acidity that keeps it moving along. Tangerine and bell pepper flavors on the finish are fitting.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tart cran-apple fruit—some of it from 35-year-old vines—is at the heart of this vineyard-designated cuvée. It has a woody/earthy undertone, tart acids and some stiffening tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Merlot and 30% Syrah, this has aromas of red currant, cedar and a whiff of white pepper. The straightforward, easy-drinking palate offers black cherry, clove, coffee and licorice alongside polished tannins. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Darkly colored, this comes from the slopes above the small town of Buzet. It has structure and layers of black currant fruit and juicy acidity. With its firm tannins and ripe fruitiness, the wine will age. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This quite tart, young and spicy red pulls sharp and puckery cranberry fruit into focus. It's best enjoyed chilled, and would be a fine option for the base of a wine punch.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fleshy, oxidized aromas hint at complexity but fall more toward wheat, wax and waywardness. Round in body, with vital acidity, this tastes of creamy oak, peach, dried apricot and lemon. This French-owned Chilean operation has been striving for years to make Chablis-style Chardonnay in the Andes; so far the results haven't been convincing.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A mineral layering of waxy pear gives this wine a light, crisp complexion, punctuated by subtle, oaky spice and plenty of vibrant lemon. Light on the palate, it'll serve well for larger gatherings.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sourced from a range of vineyards across the Napa Valley, including Atlas Peak, Rutherford and Oakville, this intense wine is informed by thick-grained tannins and pronounced oak. Dark blackberry fruit and clove season it well, along with a finish steep in mocha. The blend includes a small amount of Merlot.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Black plum, violet and baking spice aromas emerge in the glass. The soft palate offers blueberry, blackberry, grilled herb and white pepper alongside sleek tannins. It's smooth and accessible so enjoy soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh black fruits give this wine a bright start in life. It is rich with some tannins and dark spice. Dominant berry-fruit flavors are balanced with acidity and a dry, firm aftertaste. Drink from the end of 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese, this has a subdued nose that doesn't give much away. The palate offers dried black cherries, blackberry extract, vanilla, licorice and new oak but the fruit is drying up quickly, leaving an abrupt, astringent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This fresh blend of Négrette with both Cabernets is fruity and lightly crisp with refreshing final acidity. It's bright, while also having a ripe character that allows it to broaden out. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light colored and fruity, this has the typical Négrette polish, aromas and dry tannins accompanied by red berry fruits, with a richer, full aftertaste. The wine is made to drink young, so drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine has firm tannins certainly. However its main character is the delicious, juicy fruit that just bursts out of the glass. A fresh character suggests this wine will develop quickly, despite the tannic background. Drink from 2016.\n",

      "Baked strawberry and a bittersweet note of cherry play off the palate around a medium-bodied frame of subtle tannin and oak. Dried cranberry comes in as a secondary detail, before the wine finishes in a blaze of leather and black tea.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is the most substantial of the winery's 2012 Pinots, with black cherry and cola flavors dominant. There's a hint of gun metal and a lick of chocolate wrapping into a short, rather thin finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very perfumed with wood and strong berry flavors, this stalky, structured wine has tannins that are already well integrated into the spicy, juicy red fruits. Bold flavors and tasty fruitiness are well balanced with the texture and dry core. Drink now.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "With a light salmon color and aromas of citrus, apple, spiced pumpkin and minerals, this is tangy and citrusy on the palate, with flavors of orange and pink grapefruit. A fresh, solidly composed finish provides for a healthy conclusion.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Burgundy- and California-based Boisset's Rhône outpost has turned out an excellent value in this medium-bodied, firmly structured 2012. Black cherry and leather notes predominate, but pick up welcome hints of espresso, black olive and clove. Drink now–2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Notios blend offers aromas and flavors of pert lemon, sea salt and spice, with an attractive acid balance. Focused and fresh but with some complexity, it's a god expression of Greek terroir and style.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "White peach, tropical fruit and citrus typify this curvy white punctuated by fragrant Viognier. The rounded fruit is buoyed by Assyrtiko's brisk acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Featuring another awesomely illustrated label, this wine starts off a bit funky on the nose with dewy bay leaf, oregano-crusted plum fruits and a bit of tobacco. It treads the lighter side of the grape, showing rustic elderberry and more damp herb flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aging on the lees for a few months has given this fresh white wine also richness. It has lemon juice and crisp apple flavors and a bright mineral acidity at the end. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe aromas of passionfruit, ruby red grapefruit and a juicy grass element show on the nose of this wine by Andres Ibarra and Caren Rideau. That ripeness tightens on the palate, with Granny Smith apple skins, yellow grapefruit juice and pressed green apples.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cherry and watermelon aromas are fair and easy, while raspberry and plum-skin flavors finish pithy and citrusy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "High-pitched leather, chewing tobacco and desiccated black-fruit aromas lead on the nose. On entrance the wine feels loose and easy, but a medium amount of chewy tannins give footing to the second half of the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pressed flowers, undergrowth and blood orange lead to a lithe, medium-weight palate that comes with juicy acidity. The finish features hints of desiccated black fruit and clover honey.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fado, wine and song, reads the label, and Fado is the essentially Portuguese style of music. The wine is more international in character, ripe, soft and smooth, with attractive acidity and juicy fruit. Drink through 2016.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Minerally red-berry aromas suggest vitamins and latex. Like most RDD jovens, this is raw and rubbery in feel, with high-intensity plum and berry flavors. A loud, acidic finish is fresh as can be but entirely simple in terms of complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Two bottles were tasted; the first sour and disjointed, the second, considerably better, with tart lemon and green apple fruit and some pretty orange-peel highlights. It's finished with a screwcap so a bad cork is not an issue, but watch out for bottle variation.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "While the wine is rich and tarry, it has an old-fashioned feel to it that comes from the juicy tannins and touch of rusticity. That's not unattractive, a wood-aged oxidized wine that has fruit and spice to add to its allure. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sourced from Saralee's Vineyard-Matthew Station, it offers indelible savory and herbal notes, a chewy sense of wild strawberry and a drying finish for a curious, more thirst-quenching take on Tannat.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Cabernet-dominated wine is elegant, structured with plenty of black currant and berry fruits that give a fresher element. With firm tannins that need to soften, it will age. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This cool Cabernet packs enough ripeness to sustain the more stalky character. It is full of red berry fruits, smoky acidity and a core of tannin. Drink now, best lightly chilled.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A 100% Viognier that's heady in ripe pit fruit, mostly sweet peach, and accented in nutty, floral aromas. It's full-bodied and  robust, with tannins that are soft and juicy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A hint of ripe apricot gives extra dimension to the core of strawberry preserves and cedar. With its mild tannins and tender acids, this is an easy-to-drink wine that will pair well with grilled pizza.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose is overwhelmed by oak sensations of roasted coffee bean, espresso and toast. The marked wood influence carries over to the palate, which displays oak extract, coconut, coffee, chocolate, vanilla and plum accents alongside drying wood tannins and racy acidity. There's no fruit richness to stand up to the dominant oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromatic and intense, it deals stewed-peach and spring flower aromas. The medium-bodied palate packs plenty of flavor, and lively acids keep the wine feeling chiseled.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe aromas of baked berry and raisin stop short of being too ripe. In the mouth, this basic Tempranillo is chunky but balanced by fresh acids. Plum, prune and spice flavors finish loamy and plump. Good wine for $8.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A mild note of blueberry scone hits the nose first, followed by touches of grilled herb and flower. The palate proves to be quite finessed, showcasing firm but buffed tannins and agile acids. Dark cherry and pastry spice notes mark the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "While the wine does have tannins, it's dominant characters are juicy red fruits, sweet tannins and a fresh, lightly mineral texture. It's a wine that's ready to drink, fruity while firm at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "White currant aromas give an exotic character that is confirmed by the spice and ripe apricot flavors. Acidity is bright and fresh while the aftertaste moves the wine more to a warmer character.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 20-acre estate has produced a firm but already attractively ripe wine. It is still young and juicy, with black currant flavors dominating. The tannins are solid and need a while to soften. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Strongly herbaceous, it's also packed with gooseberry and grapefruit flavors. It's a sharp as a knife, very crisp and deliciously fresh, with a distinctly mineral aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The young tannins are keeping the wine dry at the moment. But the flavors of black currant fruitiness and fresh acidity promise a bright and fruity future. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh, light and fruity, it has ripe strawberry flavors, bright acidity and just a touch of caramel. It is full in the mouth, with a rounded feel and a soft texture at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Young and spicy, this easy-drinking Pinot Gris still shows some bite and some bitterness, perhaps from skin contact. Give it a little more bottle age, and drink it chilled, to bring out the tart fruit and cut the phenolics.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Clean, fresh and inviting aromas are simple as rosé should be. Plum, raspberry and other red-fruit flavors are full and tight, with ripeness, acidity and just a hint of sweetness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Red-fruit aromas of plum and berry are earthy and a bit stalky. The palate is tight, narrow and crisp more than flush. Spice, a touch of green herbs and then raspberry and plum flavors finish herbal, spicy and drying in feel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light in color, it brings notes of cranberry, currant and vanilla, with the barrel notes getting out front. The palate is broad in feel with tart cranberry flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Generous on the palate, this wine from the famous site is ripe with wild strawberry and pomegranate fruit and accented with the distinct spiciness of cardamom. It displays its youth through assertive tannins and oak-derived scents, layering the thick finish with cinnamon bark.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big flavors and structure come together perfectly in this full-bodied, dry wine that's meant for the dinner table. Its unique fruit character combines raspberry, blackberry and rhubarb, while firm tannins and vibrant acidity create an appetizing, mouth-cleansing texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made in a convincing dry style, this medium-bodied wine starts off with hints of lime and kerosene, then adds peach kernel and citrus flavors on the smooth-textured palate. Finishes long.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A hint of lemon and yeast leads the nose of this wine. Its light-footed palate brings in more yeasty savoriness and texture before ample lemon zest flavors kick in with appetizing freshness. This has concentration and light-heartedness in equal and abundant measure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bosc pear, yellow apple and honey scents follow through to the radiant, medium-bodied palate, along with nectarine and Mediterranean herb notes. An energizing mineral tone adds depth.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "Hearty floral-tinged black-currant aromas and warm cocoa and licorice notes show on the nose of this vineyard blend from the eastern Santa Ynez Valley. Bright acidity carries blackberry, pepper and roasting herb flavors on the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Enticing fragrant wildflower, orchard fruit and aromatic herb aromas waft out of the glass. The round, enveloping palate doles out ripe pear, white cherry, white peach and salty mineral notes. Fresh acidity brightens the almond-laced finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is 71% Malbec and 29% Cabernet Sauvignon. High-toned aromas of dried herb, cherry, tobacco, plum and barrel spice lead to pillowy soft, dazzlingly textured, mouthwatering fruit flavors. It's a big-time winner.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Delicate wet slate aromas meet wafts of rose blossom and baseball-card bubblegum on the nose of this rosé. The palate offers delicious and approachable strawberry flavors, held together with a steely edge.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Yeasty savor and saltiness mingle with yellow pear scents on the nose of this wine. The palate adds juicy, ripe yellow plum to the mix, expanding its flavor to full-on fruitiness, with a baseline of zest and saltiness. It's generously packed, with a clean, dry and lasting finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a rich wine that is full of spicy aromatic fruit. It is classy and elegant while having some weight. Red fruits and orange zest are given a perfumed herbal edge from the Mourvèdre in the blend. This is real food wine, ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Classic varietal aromas of hay, tomato vine and tropical fruit take center stage in this expressive white, accented with a whiff of wet stone. The savory palate doles out juicy grapefruit, green melon, yellow peach and mineral flavors, with tangy acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bruce McGuire makes a strong case for the potential of Petit Verdot—a variety not often bottled on its own—in the Santa Ynez Valley. Baked blackberry, licorice and cocoa scents show on the playful nose, while black cherry, cocoa dust, cardamom and anise flavors light up the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Green apple, Bartlett pear and citrus aromas follow through to the bright, creamy palate, along with a stony mineral note. An elegant, balanced wine with a fresh, lingering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tart but full cranberry aromas meld with sagebrush and cardamom on the nose of this bottling from an increasingly popular vineyard in this appellation. Baking spice and dried ginger mark the palate, which is acid-driven and lively, accenting its core of raspberry and pencil lead flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This cofermented field blend is 60% Tannat and 40% Malbec. It's big, black, bold and captivating, with rich blackberry and boysenberry fruit. The tannins are grainy and flecked with graphite, and there's a suggestion of mocha throughout. This might fool some tasters if it were to be tossed into a blind tasting of high-octane Sonoma Zinfandels.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Like so many wines from this site, this is explosive and powerfully rich, yet a lurking acidity keeps it fresh and in check. Notes of cedar, dried herb and pencil shavings meet integrated oak and firm tannin, as brambly blackberry and blueberry flavors linger with clove-tinged spice on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy aromas of forest floor, grilled mushroom, red fruit and leather slowly take shape in the glass. The chewy palate offers plum, licorice, Marasca cherry and clove flavors, framed by firm, fine-grained tannins that lend a polished texture and a tight finish. Drink through 2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This limited cuvée is made from the smallest block at the estate vineyard. It's entirely hand-farmed, with stem-driven savory notes around strawberry fruit. There's a sense of a slightly metallic minerality threading through, with drying tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With a high proportion of the local Rolle grape in the blend, this is a lightly perfumed wine with a strong herbal element. It is a ripe finely structured wine, with great acidity and orange flavors. A style of wine that will be better for a few more months, it should be drunk from late 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Named for the producer's farmhouse and its surrounding vineyard, this offers rich cherry cordial and weedy sage notes—a seamless mix of fruit and earth. Sage, cardamom and spicy white pepper flavors give it intrigue and complexity, wrapped in a thick, velvety texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark red cherry and baked red currant fruit meet a slightly meaty aroma on the tangy nose of this bottling from Chuck Carlson. It's lively on the palate, with punchy acidity and grippy texture, showing dried herb and tart red fruit flavors, making a strong case for growing Cabernet Franc in the region.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This young wine has great potential. With powerful tannins and a dense texture, it is rich in black fruits and acidity. Concentrated and with a firm structure, the wine will age well. Produced from a blend that puts Bordeaux grapes with a small proportion of the local Abouriou, it will be ready in 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A solid, compelling bottling for an entry-level wine, this was aged in a combination of French oak, acacia wood and concrete, and shows clean Gala apple and brioche aromas. Grippy tension and sizzling acidity fire up the palate, bringing the wine's apple and peach flavors to the fore, sprinkled with savory sea salt and spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From an old vineyard on chalky soil, this wine has some concentration as well as a tight mineral texture. This is warm and ripe as well as fruity and crisp. It is a rich wine that has also retained crispness and great acidity. Drink from the end of 2017 or even early 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a chalky power to the nose of this lightly hued wine, its baking soda aromas melding with rose petal, lime peel and watermelon scents. There's tremendous tension to the palate, where bubblegum and ambrosia melon flavors meet limestone-like minerality. Ripe enough to make it playful, it's bright enough to drink all day.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light and almost effervescent in the glass, this popular Grenache-based pink from Doug Margerum offers yeasty, Champagne-like aromas, soft lemon-peel scents and wet slate minerality. The palate's tingling acidity delivers chalky lime and cotton candy flavors, bound together with compelling tension.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A wonderfully herbal lift of mint precedes ripe cherry fruit on the nose of this wine. The palate brims with lusciously ripe plum, while supple tannins provide a velvety but firm background against which the mellow fruit can play. It's fresh, juicy and full-bodied.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Vineyards close to the sea produce a beautiful crisp wine, with red fruits, a touch of saltiness and tangy acidity. Cool fermentation has kept so much delicious flavorsome fruit. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In homage to its Bordeaux heritage from a previous owner, the wine has Cabernet Sauvignon in the otherwise typical Provence blend. That gives extra structure, as well as adding some red-currant flavors. This second rosé from the estate is ripe, richly endowed and ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bold boysenberry flavors and a broad, juicy texture make this full-bodied wine appealing and easy to enjoy. The texture is moderately tannic and everything tastes well proportioned.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sémillon (60%) makes up the majority of this blend followed by Sauvignon Blanc (22%) and Muscadelle. The aromas of wet stone, lees, orange rind and fresh flowers are light and elusive. The palate brings a sense of elegance and balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh and bright aromas of blackberry pastry and black-cherry fruit show on the nose of this wine from a longtime Paso producer. There are tart tannins on the palate, with red-cherry flavors enhanced by turned black earth, dried mint and dill.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of sugared plums, herbs and black currants lead to black- and blue-fruit flavors that are surprisingly soft. One misses the tannins Cabernet is known for but it makes up for it elsewhere.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy and rustic, this intensely tannic wine has a dry character. The fruit is all there, hiding behind this rough exterior. Allow the wine time to soften out and drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of char and toast are quite up front, though they smooth out over time and give way to lemon meringue. The tropical fruit, butter and spice flavors are broad and well balanced, with a creamy feel and a lingering finish. The oak gets out front, but there are good things going on.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Merlot (55%) and Cabernet Franc (41%) make up the majority of this blend, which is rounded out by Petit Verdot. Aromas of dried red fruit, herbs and woodspice lead to elegant, zingy, dried cranberry and spice flavors that linger.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This tight, young wine has a steely, mineral texture as well as juicy fruits.Those fruits need to develop to give the full potential of this perfumed wine. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from vines between 20 and 40 years old, this wine is both fresh and ripe. Apple as well as citrus flavors give it a tangy streak. Made from organic and biodynamically grown grapes, it is all fruit, bright and with an attractive, perfumed aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An unusually rich wine for Sancerre, this is packed with apple and pear fruits, with a soft touch of honey to fill out the palate. It is ripe, full of fruit and immediately drinkable, soft at the end while still fresh.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This perfumed wine has light, ripe fruits and soft tannins. Red cherry and raspberry flavors dominate the palate of a wine that is still young. Drink this attractive wine from 2017.\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 900-foot-high vineyard produces wines that are flinty, mineral and tight. With its textured character and zesty lemon notes, this wine is fresh yet still developing. Plenty of fruitiness will explode in the next few months. Drink after 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From nose to finish, there's a distinctly floral tone to this vibrant, delicately framed Riesling. Dry in style, it offsets fresh, cutting grapefruit and tangerine flavors against perfumed notes of potpourri and talcum powder. Drink now through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A solid wine for the price, this often sells for less than suggested retail in grocery stores. This bottling shows bacon fat, tart blackberry, black loam and baked goods on a just-enough-of-everything nose. The soft palate is smooth, with mouth-coating tannins and flavors of cigar leaf, black currant and black pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of spice, lees and ripe pear are followed by creamy feeling tropical fruit flavors, with pineapple in the lead. It doesn't quite all come together but provides plenty of intrigue.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Nick Elliott's blend of 53% Grenache, 28% Syrah and 19% Mourvèdre offers crushed black raspberries, boysenberries, rose petals and touches of oak and caramel on the nose. The palate shows shows tar, black pepper and slightly sour blueberry, proving straightforward.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fragrant blue flower, red berry, tilled soil and a whiff of new leather take center stage on this bright red. The ripe, straightforward palate delivers crushed Marasca cherry and baking spice alongside round, mature tannins. It's straightforward and already rather evolved so enjoy sooner rather than later.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lemon grass, underripe pineapple and freshly mowed lawn lead to tastes of grapefruit pith and white flowers. It has a strong backbone of minerality and a very slight sweetness on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This garnet-colored wine made from 100% Kallmet has aromas of black cherry, black pepper and red plums. It has flavors of red raspberry, cinnamon and red plums. The tannins are soft and round and the finish is persistent.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bold, penetrating tannins and bright cranberry acidity lend a tight frame to this classically styled Blaufränkisch, a.k.a. Lemberger. Crisp-tart blackberry and blueberry flavors are accented by bramble and herb notes that linger long on the finish. Its quite closed now, but should show well after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This cherry-colored wine offers the nose baking spice, tart cherry and black peppercorns. It has a medium body with nice minerality and flavors of blueberry jam, tart cherries and dried violets.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Salted stonefruit, Key-lime pie and eggy brioche notes show on the nose of this entry-level Viognier from the longtime producer. The palate offers lime blossoms, white peach, slight quinine and a touch of caramel in the midpalate, presented with a grippy texture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mature plum, underbrush, truffle, violet and mocha aromas come together on this savory wine. The firm palate offers juicy wild cherry, espresso, licorice and white pepper alongside assertive tannins that leave a rather astringent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright, jammy aromas and ripe, lively, chocolate and cherry flavors give a lot of personality to this velvet-textured wine. Medium to full bodied, it has a good blanket of fine tannins to coat the tongue and give the wine grip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Apple and stone-fruit aromas are a little oily and starting to fade. Driving acidity keeps this in forward mode, but there's an empty gap in the middle of the palate. Waxy apple, apricot and orange flavors finish just juicy enough. Drink immediately.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An appealing personality makes this a good go-to wine. Aromas combine a light spicy quality with tasty black cherry and berry notes. Flavors add rich fruit and a little spiciness, and the mouthfeel is supple.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Toast, espresso and mocha aromas lead the nose while the bracing palate offers raw red berry, anise, coffee and a hint of chocolate. Grainy tannins provide firm support but leave an astringent finish. Wait another few years for the tannins to soften a bit then drink up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plum, cassis, herb and spice aromas make for a full, pleasant bouquet. This shows a thick tannic plodding palate along with quick-hitting berry and cassis flavors. Lasting acidity on the finish creates welcome freshness and length.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crisp stony lightly herbal plum aromas are moderately smoky. This feels flush and pleasant, with a full body and flavors of plum, cassis and tomato sauce. A controlled composed finish benefits from lasting acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Macho grapy aromas are offset by spunky raspberry scents. Fruity and a bit narrow and grabby across the palate, this delivers Mendoza's patented black-fruit flavors wrapped in chocolaty oak. Spice and oak remain present on a full finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a great find in this category. Gentle, floral notes of honey and apple mark nose and palate. The light body gives a charming, almost delicate character to this well-balanced and refreshing sweet wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Leesy fleshy papaya aromas come with a touch of sulfur and harshness. This feels solid, albeit modest in bubbles. Flavors of apple and green melon are lasting and steady on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich, fruity and textured, this expresses freshness with its acidity and red-currant flavors. These cut through the tangy texture, giving a tight aftertaste. The wine can be drunk immediately for its crispness or held until late 2016 to let it soften.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The aromas of wild strawberries, spice and sarsaparilla are immediate in their appeal. The palate is light bodied and elegant, with mouthwatering acids and flavors that linger. This wine is delicate but brings a lot of enjoyment.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine offers clean, slightly dilute raspberry fruit, along with lovely aromatics and a persistent, engaging finish. In spite of the lightness, it holds your interest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Oak, almond and nutmeg represent the rounder, lusher aspects of the 10% Sémillon in this Sauvignon Blanc-based wine, complemented by creamy pear, peach and melon. The two work together well, providing soft layers of crisp goodness in a glass.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of exotic spice, plum, violet and a whiff of chopped herb lead the nose. The firm palate delivers tart red cherry, espresso, anise, vanilla and coconut alongside brisk acidity and grainy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Notes of cinnamon and peppercorns adds complexity to the cranberry-pomegranate fruit and slate minerality on the nose of this single-vineyard expression. It's more reserved in its palate, which offers cranberry tang with an herbal sagebrush quality, proving a reliable, straightforward take on the grape.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of plum, blackberry, violet and exotic spice jump out of the glass. The bright, polished palate offers black cherry, raspberry jam and black pepper alongside fresh acidity. It's made for immediate drinking pleasure so enjoy soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soft and buttery, this drink-now style is as smooth as a polished stone. The fruit is fairly generic and light, but the penetrating punch of popcorn and nut oil carries it along nicely.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is tightly wound yet intense, ripe and tart in cherry, rose and lush earth. Baking spices make their way through the density of fruit, while the texture struggles to find balance. Let this powerfully built wine open in the glass.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sun-kissed grapefruit and tangerine flavors are accented by darker notes of bramble and lime zest in this crisp, cutting Riesling. Off-dry, juicy yet refreshing and light-footed, it's an everyday wine with a touch of flair and elegance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh yellow cherries and greengage plums perfume this spry but lushly textured Riesling. It is dry in style, but has a comforting clinginess that enriches the finish. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Waxy aromas of lanolin, dried apple and cheese set up a plump well-balanced palate, with plenty of body weight and adequate acidity. Peach, apple and melon flavors are moderately stony and minerally, while this varietal Garnacha Blanca finishes with good length.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with somewhat rustic aromas of overripe fruit, truffle, game and a whiff barnyard. The round, accessible palate is already evolved, showing dried black cherry, mocha, anisette and a confectionary note alongside smooth tannins. Drink sooner rather than later.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe and full, this comes from a producer based just south of the Côtes de Blancs. Yellow fruits are cut with citrus to give a rich, while refreshing wine. Smooth with an orange-zest texture, it is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose on this widely available bottling is vivacious and juicy, with strawberry, strawberry blossoms and raspberries laid across a pencil-lead frame. It tightens on the palate, with lots of graphite and pencil shavings, showing just a bit of pomegranate fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of orange peel and orange essence are oily and bring softer notes of melon, apple and tropical fruits. This is bright but basic on the tongue, with cutting acidity. Tropical flavors of green melon and mango are ratcheted by citric acidity, while the finish is citrusy and pithy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Well made, well rounded and well balanced, this medium-bodied wine has tasty fruit aromas and flavors. Spicy accents accompany a firm, layered texture and lasting finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Apple and peach aromas are clean and pure. This feels round yet compact, with orange, nectarine and pithy flavors. Green-apple tartness and malic acidity push a pure finish that doesn't balk.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pine forest and tart, lean drops of cranberry, rhubarb and pomegranate combine for a complex, savory and compelling vineyard-designate. A strong presence of tannin marks the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of red berry, grilled herb, oak-driven spice and a balsamic note lead the nose on this. The palate is still tight and closed but eventually gives up raw cherry, strawberry, sage and espresso alongside assertive, raspy tannins. Let the tannins soften a bit and then drink up before the fruit fades.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The fruit is the star here, ripe and round. Flavors are a nice mix of orange, apple and pear, with a light dusting of baking spices. This is drinking at its freshest peak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rustic leathery aromas are capped and low on vibrant fruit scents. In the mouth, expect tannic scratchiness. Flavors of plum, cassis and toasty oak come across as mildly baked, while a narrow finish with notes of earth, loam and chocolate is solid. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raisin and prune aromas indicate full ripeness, while jammy fig notes come in later and confirm this wine's warm-vintage DNA. A clampy palate with big tannins offers inky flavors of plum and prune, while an oaky concentrated finish feels jammy. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tropical fruit aromas are suggestive of bath soap and body oil. This feels obtuse, with depth and an oily sensation to the palate. Chunky, ripe, oily flavors of melon and orange finish loud and ripe, with a deeper set of tropical fruit flavors than your average Argentine Torrontés.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Strong wood aromas mark this wine that's shot through with wood-aging flavors. Spice and smoky toast are evident, but the ripe blackberry flavors are big enough to balance this Merlot-dominated wine. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a smooth, velvet-textured wine. Its tannins are totally integrated into the ripe berry flavors. With its soft texture and open structure, it is almost ready to drink now. Wait until late 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Lightly fruity in aroma and flavor, this has a very smooth, soft texture and just a hint of citric crispness for balance. It is medium bodied, clean and fresh.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is all about fruit with only a passing reference to tannins. Red berry flavors come with just a dash of minerality and a firmer, wood-aged core. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Basketball star John Salley is the spokesman for this eco-minded project by Clos La Chance. The wine offers aromas of wet granite and fermenting apples. The flavors are similar, showing pear, slate and green-apple skins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This lightly aromatic wine conveys ripe red apple, pear, and star fruit. The fruit flavors are centered in a ball in the middle, offering plenty of appeal if not much complexity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose is reluctant at first, but patience reveals struck match, smoke, slight mint and tar elements. The palate is dominated by tart red fruit, like cranberry skins, bolstered with pinches of brown spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark in color, with rooty, leafy aromas of berry fruits that turn flatter with airing, this warm-style Pinot Noir feels wide and grabby, with some flab on its hips. Black plum and toasty flavors simmer on an dull, weighty finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Priced affordably for the appellation, this is a somewhat balanced Cab suggestive of bell pepper and jalapeño that dance around in smoke, currant and cedar. It finishes dry and tannic in vanilla oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Super Tuscan-like blend of 81% Sangiovese and 19% Cabernet Sauvignon, whose name refers to the little stones on the estate, shows reductive aromas of black olive, rubber and dried pressed purple flowers. Flavors range from mushroom to slate, but the tannins need mellowing and it could use a little more air altogether.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Crafted from a field blend of varieties, including Carignan, Syrah and Durif, this holds a syrupy sense of meaty bacon and plum raisin at its center. Midweight and fairly straightforward in terms of flavor, it finishes fast and not overly complex.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light in color, this suggests berry, herbs and wood. It's airy in feel with tart cranberry-juice flavors and a puckering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is bottled by the local Médoc cooperative, although it comes from a single estate. With firm tannins and a dense structure, it's austere. The stalky black fruits are only just ripe, giving a green pepper character.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is lean and austere, with extracted tannins that have left no sense of fruit. It will remain hard, although it will be less dry from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Gravel and limestone soils provide two different origins for this wine. That said, burnt wood and smoky tannins are the only tastes at the moment. the wine does have enough weight and potential to soften out, so drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a salinity to this wine, which is grown to the west of Gilroy on the lower foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Aromas are brackish and suggest sweet lemons, while the palate offers apples, squeezed citrus and a waxy character.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Despite coming from the even-keeled 2012 vintage, this nearly 100% varietal wine doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with notes of green pepper, herbs and bittersweet chocolate. It's medium bodied with sweet cherry and clove flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This aromatic wine suggests candied red apple, jasmine and ale. It's medium sweet with a lightly spritzy feel and ale notes throughout.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made with 60% Syrah and 40% Merlot, this wine brings notes of sugared blue fruit, herbs and tire rubber. The fruit flavors are soft in feel but the chalky, dry tannins detract.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pithy citrus aromas are heavy and strangely herbal for a white wine. Pulpy and wide in feel, with little midpalate structure, this tastes of citrus rind, white grapefruit and nopal. A zesty note reprises on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is attractively fruity, crisp and perfumed. With red currant fruits and refreshing acidity, it's fresh and light in character. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas are light with whiffs of apricot and pineapple. On the palate, the concentration of the stone and tropical fruit flavors is wanting but the wine still brings some appeal.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mild, almost dilute aromas of strawberry and raspberry aren't fully convincing for Cabernet. In the mouth, however, this weighs in heavy and seeking balance. Flavors of berry and plum are baked, while candied sweetness and blueberry notes drive a jammy finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Some good things are going on with this wine, including abundant red fruit and a soft feel. However the wood overpowers them with strong aromas and flavors of vanilla, dill and coconut along with a bitter note that distracts.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas recall jasmine, botrytis and tangerine. It drinks medium sweet with honeyed fruit flavors and a clipped finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Heavy wood aromas lead to a wine that's dominated by burnt wood with only subdued fruit. It's packed with tannins that are tough and extracted, giving a bitter coffee flavor. Although it will soften, the wine will likely keep its dry, tough character.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Considerable toasted wood flavors show from both the aroma and the initial taste. The fruit is lean, without the weight needed for balance. It's likely to remain an austere wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine's nose is all about earth and minerality, showing iron, rust, mushrooms and eucalyptus, but in a rather pungent way. The flavors are sanguine, nearly metallic, with Indian spices and cranberry fruit combining for a sip that is lean in body but grippy with tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The tartness in this wine veers slightly sour, with the acidity dialed perhaps a notch too high. Herb and salt intermix to give a more savory character, with a freshness to the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Candied cherry and red-plum aromas precede an edgy palate and herbal flavors of plum and berry that are slightly hot and spicy. Raspberry and red-currant flavors on the finish are dilute.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This big and tannic wine has an exotic spice and herb aroma, like rosemary and clove, then lots of dark fruit flavors plus smoke, black pepper and espresso. The texture is dry and very firm, and the thick layer of tannins will need more time to soften. Best after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of mature blackberry, white pepper and exotic spice lead the nose. A 50-50 blend of Aglianico and Piedirosso, the firm palate offers raspberry jam, toasted oak, espresso and oak-driven spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blackberry pie stars in this soft, grippy estate wine, held in both French and American oak, only a third of it new. Integrated tannins provide an approachability, along with a strong suggestion of leather.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Brambly berry and heaps of brown sugar combine for a thick, soft and richly layered wine that pushes the limits in terms of ripeness. It has small amounts of Mourvèdre, Charbono and Carignane blended throughout and was aged in one-third new French oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a lusty, bombastic and burly wine, completely in keeping with the producer's style, mixing smoky bacon, tar, cigar and charcuterie with smooth, round layers of concentration and ripeness. With a handful of Petite Sirah, it aged 14 months in American oak, a charred note that lingers on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tropical fruit, spice and honey on the nose give this Malagousia and Assyrtiko blend an opulent, exotic start. Balance is struck with its citrus and melon fruit backed by a clean acidity. Clean but full of character.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A full-bodied, robust expression of the variety from an appellation that can sometimes be relatively cool, this shows deft characteristics of savory pepper, cedar and a tightness of lively acidity. While fresh it's also heavy, with a finish of black tea.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A tad light on the nose but offering white pepper, black pepper, fresh-pressed boysenberry and lavender. The mouthfeel is soft with olallieberry, plum skins, fresh purple flowers and touches of cola and coffee bean. The winery just opened a new tasting room west of Paso.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This atypical blend of 56% Syrah and 44% Merlot shows red roses and red currants on the rather light nose. The palate is also delicately layered with light red plums, tangy strawberries and a tight bay leaf herbal component.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 80% Carricante and 20% Catarratto, this offers heady aromas of Spanish Broom, linden blossom and white stone fruit. The bright palate offers yellow apple, unripe peach, lemon zest and mineral alongside refreshing acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Leathery, clipped, briary black-fruit aromas are heavily oaked and smoky. This feels like a bag of nails, with a sucking texture. Barrel-heavy flavors of charred blackberry and cassis are resiny and dry, with clove notes and pounding tannins. Hold as long as you wish; this can only benefit from more time in the bottle.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "After 12 months in 22% new French oak, this well-made wine offers pleasing scents of toast and butter. Similar flavors are married to clean apple and pear. Drink now through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Beeswax and acacia aromas lift out of the glass while the bright palate offers ripe pear, nectarine and grilled herb. Mineral and almond notes add interest.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Alluring aromas of grilled herb, spring blossom, citrus and crushed stone lift out of the glass. The palate is understated but refined, offering lime, tangerine zest, sage and a hint of saline alongside bright acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a ripe, red-fruit dominated wine with rich strawberry and cream flavors that are immediately attractive, With its balanced acidity, the wine is ready to drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This fruity wine has a refreshing citrus flavor. Lightly textured, it is lively and crisp. A mineral edge gives it tight structure, putting the wine into the food category.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This Slovenian red blend of 40% Cabernet Franc, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot has aromas of raspberry, cherry and a touch of green bramble. In the mouth, there is balanced acidity with flavors of cherry pie and dried plums. The finish is persistent with grippy tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Potent aromas of wood smoke and grilled baguette join fruit flavors so ripe they are almost sweet, while seductive baking spices join in. It's a great wine for oak lovers and has the potent berry-cherry flavors to back up all that spiciness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of small red berry, Spanish broom and flint come together on this vibrant rosato. Made entirely with Nerello Mascalese the direct, linear palate offers red cherry, strawberry and a mineral note alongside vibrant acidity. A hint of nut marks the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Buttery boysenberry pie, crushed vanilla and fresh blueberries converge on the nose of this bargain bottling. Soft tannins frame flavors of black currant and dark roast coffee with touches of tobacco and a caramelized finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aged in 100% new American oak, this is a potent wine with a mix of black tea, tobacco, dry earth and chalk. The fruit has a Dr. Pepper character, along with a dusting of cinnamon sugar.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Extremely ripe aromas of prune and pencil eraser are funky as per usual for this Elqui Syrah, but more sweet and generous than in past vintages. This feels quite heavy, almost oversaturated. Ultraripe blackberry and cassis flavors finish thick and gooey.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an appealing, dry, and well-balanced wine, with everything in good proportions. It has lots of fresh cherry aromas, good and deep fruit flavors and a light but tasty layer of toasted, smoky oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very ripe and fruity in character, this wine smells like cherries, raisins and spiced plums, and has a grippy texture from good acidity and moderate tannins for a little bite of astringency.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tangy and fragrant, this gives off aromas of red berry, white rose and a whiff of carob. The vibrant palate doles out juicy red cherry, red raspberry, mineral and a hint of baking spice alongside crisp acidity. It finishes crisp and clean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With just a touch of yellow fruits, this is a ripe, concentrated wine. It has something of the Chablis minerality that is combined with intense fruits and acidity. The wine is young but very drinkable now, although likely to age at least until 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of citrus, white flower and Mediterranean herb lift out of the glass. The round, juicy palate offers lime, apricot and pineapple alongside tangy acidity. A hint of white almond backs up the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "A new effort from DDO, this drops Domaine Drouhin from the name, and puts the vineyard name front and center. It's young and well-crafted, with strawberry and cherry fruit. The potential is evident for an impressive site once the vines get some age under them.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a rich, soft wine with jammy black fruits and ripe tannins. The acidity will hold the wine together and allow it to age. A mineral edge comes from the caillou (stones) in the soil—hence the wine's name. It will age, although quickly, so drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This medium-bodied wine emphasizes texture and structure instead of ripeness, and that's a good thing when serving with a rich roasted duck or quail. It has black-cherry and clove aromas, moderate fruit flavors and a tight mouthfeel due to full tannins and bracing acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This bottling is the work of Jaffurs general manager David Yates, and the 2014 shines as a great example of blending wines of varying degrees of ripeness. The nose shows thyme, olive, cranberry and fennel, with a warmer hint of vanilla. The palate offers intriguing mulberry and red plum fruit, with exotic notes ranging from sichuan peppercorn to preserved lemon to kalamata olive.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine opens in a flurry of pungent apple blossom and orange zest aromas. On the palate, it shows a zesty fullness of apple, Meyer lemon and lemongrass flavor, complemented by competing notions of stony minerality and lush creaminess on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Regional bubbly pioneer Norm Yost manages to coax stunning aromas and unique flavors from his sparkling wines. In this example, the nose offers pear cider and corn laced with lime and apple aromas. That cider element comes into play on the palate as well, where mulling spices blend with dried ginger for a full and intriguing sip.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Distinctive scents of chocolate, nougat and lemon cake swirl up from the glass, framing a dive into a tangy wine loaded with red fruits. There's a suggestion of cola, great texture, excellent length, and above all an approachable, yet ageworthy, structure.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The unfolding layers of aroma on the nose of this bottling—sesame, white pepper, rose and wild berry, to name a few—keep one coming back for more. The palate is textured and finishes on an uplifting note, showing raspberry, dried flowers, fresh herbs and a hint of menthol toward the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This particular block was first planted in 2007, so these are young vines. Sometimes fruit from young vines will burst forth in spectacular fashion, and that's the case here. Supremely aromatic, this opens with a velvety mix of Asian spices, fruit leather, plum, cherry, cocoa powder and coffee grounds. All this and more can be tasted as well as sniffed, with excellent penetration through a lingering, cedary finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cherry pie aromas kick off the nose of this bottling from a steep hilllside site behind Cambria. Clove, nutmeg and maple-cured bacon notes follow. Blackberry, vanilla and clove flavors glide on the palate, which offers ample tannins and acidity for cellaring, although the wine is delicious now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's been lots to like from this SoCal winery, and this bottling adds to the list. Rusty in color, it offers cranberry, strawberry, sagebrush and iron aromas. The palate pops with zesty pomegranate fruit, lifted by herbal garrigue notes and spice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A 100% varietal, single-vineyard wine, aged nearly two years in French oak, 65% new, this is expansive in chalky red fruit and rustic saddle leather notes, the tannins billowy and round. A rich cocoa-like undertone plays nicely on the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Marc Piro broke away from his day job at Au Bon Climat to produce this first vintage of his own delicious wine. Cranberry and pomegranate aromas meld with sagebrush, thyme and peppercorn on the nose. Bright energy pops on the palate, showing cherry, cranberry, sage and bay leaf flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This single-clone cuvée really shines in 2014, with concentrated berry and cherry fruit, accented with toasty oak. The persistence and follow-through takes you down a lush flavor trail, with touches of caramel, sassafras and cola along the way.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dried herb, dust and compost provide a dark underbelly in this vineyard-designated varietal wine. It's layered with caramel and toffee notes that are complemented by bright acidity and further freshened by sparks of pomegranate and cassis.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full-bodied, rich and chewy, this is a big, bold wine. Ample oak frames black cherry and cassis fruit, adding hints of vanilla and dark chocolate to the fudge-like impression. Warmth suffuses the palate, but doesn't quite progress to full-blown high-alcohol heat. There's no doubting its impressive intensity and ripeness. Drink now–2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In the village of Soussans, and in the north of the Margaux appellation, this estate has a fine reputation for its wines. This vintage, with its great balance between fruit and tannins, shows why. It is a ripe wine full of black fruit and with the bright acidity of the vintage. Drink the wine from 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tightly structured, this is a dense wine. Packed with dry tannins, it is starting life as a firm wine. It is equally rich in fruit, a panoply of black plums and red currants. Drink this concentrated wine from 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Owned by the Cuvelier family of Léoville Poyferré in Saint-Julien and with Michel Rolland as consultant, this is a fine estate with an equally fine chateau. It is dense and richly endowed with black fruits and spice. At the same time, it has style and a way with its fruit and acidity that give it a lift. Drink this very ageworthy wine from 2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With swathes of delicious herbal and green Sauvignon Blanc fruit just delicately underpinned by the wood aging, this is a wine that is rich while remaining so crisp. It is the tangy grapefruit and crisp texture that will allow this wine to age. Drink from 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is powerful with fine tannins and concentrated black fruits. The dense texture is lifted by the acidity and beautiful fruit of the vintage. The tannins are dusty, tight and surrounded by beautiful fruit and acidity. This, the second wine of Montrose, will develop surely over the next several years. Drink from 2024.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From the vineyard on the slope above Château Pavie, this is a beautiful, juicy and ripe wine. It has a mineral character with great swathes of black-currant fruit. This is a very fine wine, well delineated, ripe and with a delicious red-currant aftertaste. Drink from 2026.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a structured wine that also has great layers of rich black fruits. They give the wine weight and intensity that is lifted by acidity. It is a powerful complex wine, concentrated and ripe. Drink from 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A lush and expressive bottling from a brand new vineyard, this shows candied black cherry, Vietnamese coffee, baking spice and licorice on the approachable nose. The ripeness extends to the palate, hemmed in by a tannic structure that ensures long aging. Asian pepper, rum barrel, caramel and cherry flavors complete the picture.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose needs air but as it wakes up, subtle notes of fragrant baked peach rise. On the palate a streak of lemon freshness provides both frame and direction, alongside a lovely apple-skin texture. Made from a blend of Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewürztraminer this unites the virtues of each variety. This is full of life and impresses with its great precision and freshness. The finish is bone dry. Lovely now but will age. Drink now through 2025.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The intense aroma of very ripe peach rises from the glass. There are nuances of orange peel, too. These become aromatically amplified on the rich, dense and almost grippy palate. There is great concentration and residual sweetness, countered by bitter pith and texture. This is mature and totally fluid, ample and generous but its maturity adds subtle tone to the eloquent aromas. The finish is medium dry and very, very long.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine clearly needs to breathe. It is only after a few minutes of airtime that it shows its true colors: then very tart and aromatic apples appear, alongside a hint of smoke and a sheer touch of lemon freshness. The palate continues on that lemony streak and is absolutely dry. The body is lithe and slender and shows great freshness and intensity. Apple and stone flavors linger. Drink 2020–2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is a touch of smoke and stone that lends a darker aspect to the ripe but crisp apple fruit. The palate has that same taut but very full-fruited feel—of very tightly held ample fruit reminiscent of red-cheeked, aromatic apples. This is both powerful and svelte. The palate is dry and finishes very clean, leaving you with haunting apple notes and fresh lemon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The gentlest floral hint is suggested on the nose. The palate, on the other hand, broods and does not want to let go of its flavors. The dry palate is stony, textured and clean but it does not yet let any fruit speak. There is real concentration and length, but it clearly is too early to enjoy this. The finish gives a suggestion of apple, but we had better wait. Drink 2020–2030.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Well structured and appetizingly tannic, this full-bodied wine from a consistently excellent producer has opulent fruit flavors, mouth-filling texture and wonderful ripeness. Black cherry, blackberry and a touch of cranberry meld with mild oak spices—a combination that lingers nicely on the finish. Best after 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Clarified butter is the first flavor to hit the palate of this wine, with a fresh, herbal essence that gives it a farmhouse feel. Cucumber and lemony acidity follow, as well as a pronounced oyster shell-like mineral note. This is a light, bright white ready for the table or as an apéritif.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Baked cherry, cardamom and cola meet a bright, citrusy undertone in this memorable wine. Lively, fresh and seamless in texture, it provides plenty of power, depth and complexity, without ever feeling heavy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From one of the most ocean-adjacent vineyards in the state, this is a swarthy and powerful bottling, showing black plum, violet, olive and coffee touches on the concentrated nose. There is a bracing acidity and upright structure to the palate, while the flavors remain power-driven: stewed plum and hoisin sauce, with an espresso-like finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh and lightly fruity, it's crisp and fragrant. With great acidity and a touch of herbaceousness, it's ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "White currant aromas give an exotic character that is confirmed by the spice and ripe apricot flavors. Acidity is bright and fresh while the aftertaste moves the wine more to a warmer character.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 20-acre estate has produced a firm but already attractively ripe wine. It is still young and juicy, with black currant flavors dominating. The tannins are solid and need a while to soften. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Strongly herbaceous, it's also packed with gooseberry and grapefruit flavors. It's a sharp as a knife, very crisp and deliciously fresh, with a distinctly mineral aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The young tannins are keeping the wine dry at the moment. But the flavors of black currant fruitiness and fresh acidity promise a bright and fruity future. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh, light and fruity, it has ripe strawberry flavors, bright acidity and just a touch of caramel. It is full in the mouth, with a rounded feel and a soft texture at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Young and spicy, this easy-drinking Pinot Gris still shows some bite and some bitterness, perhaps from skin contact. Give it a little more bottle age, and drink it chilled, to bring out the tart fruit and cut the phenolics.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Clean, fresh and inviting aromas are simple as rosé should be. Plum, raspberry and other red-fruit flavors are full and tight, with ripeness, acidity and just a hint of sweetness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Red-fruit aromas of plum and berry are earthy and a bit stalky. The palate is tight, narrow and crisp more than flush. Spice, a touch of green herbs and then raspberry and plum flavors finish herbal, spicy and drying in feel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light in color, it brings notes of cranberry, currant and vanilla, with the barrel notes getting out front. The palate is broad in feel with tart cranberry flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tight, snappy aromas of citric red fruit and lemon peel set up a driving, tight palate with brambly berry, spice and herbal flavors. This shows chocolaty oak on the finish and juicy acidity that ensures freshness and long-lasting flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spice frames the bone-dry red fruit, which carries a sharp, astringent flavor profile into a rather short, tight finish. More cellar time might help to open this up further.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Volatile and hinting at a vinegary aftertaste, this offers straightforward pomegranate fruit with spice and pepper. The finish has a little burn, despite moderate alcohol.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of Marsanne, Roussanne and Riesling, this delivers golden apple and toasted pastry-crust aromas. The middleweight palate comes with smooth lines and a lingering note of shortbread on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe cherry and raspberry aromas are accented by red flower and light turmeric tones. Lissome and juicy, the palate is robed with fine powdery tannins that lend the finish some toehold.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "In this pale rosé, freshly cut orange and papaya mousse aromas are cut with a bit of flintiness. The wine plays to the citrus side of the pink scale, with lemon rind and pink grapefruit flavors. It's a bit more watery than other rosés of the vintage.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A well-behaved 100% Chardonnay fermented in stainless steel, it had no malolactic conversion to add a buttery quality. Smooth-textured and medium-bodied, it's filled out by moderate pear and apple flavors accented with hints of white pepper, fig and vanilla.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This garnet colored wine has aromas of red plums and black pepper. There are jammy flavors of ripe cherry and red raspberry on the palate. There's a nice acidic bite and a pleasant touch of astringency on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Soft and smooth, it has warm fruit flavors and an open, generous character. It's full of apple juice, with just the lightest texture, crisp and bright at the end.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A scent of Mexican chocolate carries on to the medium-full palate, which bares polished tannins and bright acids that give lift to the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This muted, tannic Cabernet spent 20 months in new French oak. The dark black cherry and berry fruit are overwhelmed somewhat by the toast and oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a very ripe and raisiny specimen from a rocky vintage. It's chunky and somewhat grating in the mouth, with balance issues. Prune, raisin and chocolate flavors finish without much structure or spine. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From a small region just north of Pouilly Fumé, this is light and fruity. It's soft, just herbaceous and full of green apple and grapefruit flavors that give a fresh, lively character. It's completely ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Stony aromas of minerally citrus and nectarine are clean and upright. This Garnacha rosé is simple but good in feel, with generic but clean flavors of stone fruits. Bitter, pithy flavors rise up to dominate the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with weedy aromas along with whiffs of coffee, espresso and toasted oak. The raw palate displays oak, licorice and dried sage but it lacks fruit richness. Astringent tannins generate an abrupt finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is dominated by aromas of oak, toast and espresso that carry over to the palate along with black cherry. Extremely astringent wood tannins cut the finish short and leave the mouth feeling dried.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh and fruity, this is classic cool climate rosé. It has as much fresh apple as red berry fruits in its light, tight texture. It's crisp and ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intense in aromas of fresh bread and a flowery, lilac-filled garden, it offers entanglements of red cherry and strawberry within a somewhat flat structure and tannic finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Medium in body, this has pretty lemon-blossom and white peach flavors that are boosted by fresh acids, and that linger on the open-textured finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Varietally correct aromas of white flowers, lychee and tropical fruits feed into a plump, creamy palate that's losing some of the steam it probably had when it was bottled. Melon, banana and lychee flavors finish on the heavy, creamy side. Drink immediately.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aged in large oak barrels, this opens with an intense fragrance of rose and lychee that carry over to the round palate along with juicy grapefruit, white pepper and a mineral note. Pair this with spicy vegetable curry.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A blend of 60% Pinot Bianco, 30% Chardonnay and 10% Sauvignon, it conveys aromas of oak, lemon drop and candied fruits. The round palate offers intense but fleeting sensations of Golden Delicous apples and butterscotch. This is already accessible so drink soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It opens with aromas of violet, iris, ripe red berries and a whiff of vanilla. The soft palate offers fleshy black cherry, raspberry, black pepper and well-integrated oak alongside round tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big, fat and juicy, this wine has soft tannins and a full-bodied structure. It is full of the superripe Merlot that characterizes 2009, making the wine develop relatively quickly. It should be ready to drink by 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This big and ripe wine hardly tastes like Bordeaux. That is until you get beneath the rich fruit and find the firmer tannins and the juicy black currant from Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is certainly powerful with its dense texture and juicy, jammy feel. It could still age, but not for long. Drink from 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a wine with austerity and a dry, firm structure. It does have fruit to give weight to its tannins and texture. With spice as well as flavors of wood aging, it's likely to age well. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich and structured, it is full of ripe berry fruits and dense tannins. It is solid and balanced, with concentration and a very ripe feel. It needs to age a few years, so drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a serious wine from a classic vintage. While it has lost its fruit, it has gained in depth with secondary aromas of toast and leather, still kept fresh by acidity and a touch of juiciness. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Initially rough around the edges, this wine opens up to give warm red berry fruits, firm tannins and a solid structure. Underlying tannins give a dry core. A more juicy, fresh aftertaste means this wine needs some aging. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Intense aromas of peach, honeydew melon and almonds carry over to the round palate along with juicy green apples. It has nice weight and personality. The acidity generates a crisp finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A full-bodied white, it opens with aromas of lightly toasted oak, golden apple and ripe pear. The smooth palate offers yellow peach, apple and citrus with a hint of butterscotch alongside firm acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dão Sul's venture in the Alentejo has produced a wine that is soft, rich, all ripe berry fruits and gentle tannins. It's a warm, fruit-driven wine that has a rounded feel, with the acidity at the end giving some freshness. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This concentrated wine opens with aromas of toasted oak, dried flowers and a note of burned rubber. The palate offers lemon zest, dried apricot, golden apple, vanilla, oak, honey and a hint of flint.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Done in the winery's soft and fruity style, this estate-grown Chardonnay spent 10 months in French oak, half new. Buttered pears and a whiff of barrel toast create a forward, approachable wine ready for drinking in 2014.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine discloses pretty aromas of white fragrant flowers, stone fruit and cantaloupe. The palate offers juicy pineapple, white peach and pear alongside a mineral note. Crisp acidity gives a refreshing close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The mouthfeel is brittle and the acidity is brisk on this good regional expression of Pinot Noir. It shows the variety's silkiness, with sour cherry candy, cranberry and rhubarb tea flavors. Drink now–2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from the Kerner grape, which is a hybrid of Trollinger and Riesling, this silky wine begins with aromas of apricot and grapefruit, with undertones of nutmeg and clove. The crisp palate delvers white peach, pear and mineral alongside fresh acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is sheer fruit, apples and pears with a touch of apricot juice. It is ripe with a fine texture that brings out a steely edge and refreshing citrus flavors. The wine is ready to drink now until 2020\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This mix of Pommard and Dijon clones saw 30% new French oak. It's generous with strawberry and raspberry fruit, leading into pretty flavors of cherry candy as well. Hints of spice and chocolate wrap it up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A structured Sauvignon, it opens with aromas of toast, hay, earth and apricot. The rich palate delivers nectarine, pineapple, yellow peach and mineral notes with a hint of lemon drops alongside fresh acidity. The lingering finish closes on a dry note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This full-bodied white opens with aromas of dried apricots, ripe pear and a whiff of alcohol. The round, forward palate offers concentrated yellow peach, citrus, lemon drop, ginger and a hint of bread crust.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas suggest blue flower, black berries and tilled soil. The palate delivers wild cherry and raspberry accented with black pepper and hints of espresso and licorice alongside firm, drying tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Both herbal and tropical in character, this wine presents a fascinating mix between cool and warm climate grapes from the same region. The mineral, tight texture holds these two disparate flavors together to give a balanced wine that is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A zesty wine, its fragrances suggest stone fruit, cut grass, pineapple and a mineral note. The bright, lively palate delivers yellow peach, papaya and citrus alongside a steely mineral note and crisp acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A round, pleasant, 50-50 blend of Pinot Blanc and Mélon de Bourgogne (Muscadet), this is front-loaded with citrus, apple and pear fruit, nicely balanced with just enough acidity. Drink to while it's young and fresh.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This low-production Chardonnay shows the oaky, ripe notes. It has strong, forward tropical fruit, peach, lemon and lime flavors, with lots of buttered toast and vanilla bean.A firm minerality adds complexity. Drink up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A savory and vibrant wine, it discloses aromas of white fragrant flowers, green apple, exotic fruit and pear that carry over to the palate. The juicy fruit flavors are accented with mineral and an almond note. Crisp acidity leaves a clean, fresh finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "It shows a rounder structure than many Sauvignons from northeastern Italy. It opens with aromas of exotic fruit and freshly cut grass along with a note of crushed tomato vine. The palate offers ripe cantaloupe and flint and finishes on an almond note.\n",

      "This wine has some tannins that give structure as well as young fruitiness. A definite dry edge comes from the fruit as well as wood aging. The wood also brings out some bitterness that needs to soften. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The acidity on this Pinot, along with a mushroom and red tomato earthiness, mark it as Carneros. It's a bit severe and austere, but you will find ripe raspberries, as well as the sweet toastiness of oak. With a dry finish, it's less flashy than some wines , but elegant. And it should develop bottle complexity through 2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This racy, fresh, cool-vintage blend is a touch rubbery on the nose, with berry and cassis undertones. A tight palate delivers a mix of dark plum, blackberry, baking spice and chocolate flavors in front of a peppery, dry, crisp finish. Drink through 2019.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This juicy Merlot/Cabernet Franc blend is balanced and fresh with great red fruits and soft tannins. Acidity gives a crisp flavor while the fragrant smokiness allows for future development. This comes from a nine-acre, high-density, hand-picked parcel on a limestone plateau among the Querre family vineyards. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich and spicy, this 90% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon from 10 acres generous and ripe, with warm tannins and a fruity, red berry character. This blend has attractive acidity and spicy flavors from the combination of wood and stainless-steel aging. This is only the second vintage from enologist Jean-Rémi Larrat's own property. It is worth aging, so drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The ninth generation of the Dublois family goes for tight cropping on only 7.5 acres for Nectar (95% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon). Layers of wood dominate this wine. However, it does promise fruit as well, shown by the weight and richness. So it's a wine for a pause, to allow the intense spice and new wood flavors to die down. Firm and dry now, it will be worth the wait. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An aromatic and fruit filled wine with notes of cherry cordial, raspberry, herb and barrel accents. It has sweet cherry flavors with firm tannins and well balanced acidity. Best after 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The ripe fruit of this Shiraz and Touriga Nacional blend exude a character of richness and sophistication. Dusty tannins provide the framework for red fruit flavors and the generous structure. From José Luís Santos Lima Oliveira da Silva's range, the wine would be best after 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from head-trained vines planted where California winemaking pioneer Agoston Haraszthy first grew the variety 150 years ago, this lush wine offers intense aromatics of tar, brick and smoke, with briary blackberry secondary on the nose. The finish is topped by flavors of cocoa and a sprinkling of black pepper.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Near equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Malbec with a healthy dash of Petit Verdot providing the frame, it displays notes of toast, coffee, chocolate, plum and woodspice with abundant blue fruit and coffee flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a powerful wood-aged wine that is currently exhibiting dark chocolate and coffee flavors from new, smoky oak. It's the weight of the juicy fruit underneath that reveals the promise of aging. There is a mineral texture that shows the schist soil of the vineyard, all part of the dense mix. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A palate-pleasing mix of juicy boysenberry fruit, red licorice and bright spice, this quickly comes into focus. Concentrated and mouth-filling, it's a straightforward Syrah with an emphasis on fruit rather than funk.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Early aromas of menthol and oak settle on floral red berry scents and woodspice. The flavor profile of black cherry and berry is initially narrow, but with time rounds out to deliver a bright, pleasant overall character. The blend consists of 75% Carmenère, 25% Syrah and 5% Carignan.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Big flavors and full body make this deep-colored Grenache stand out. It combines aromas of ripe raspberry and boysenberry jam with hints of tobacco and cedar in the flavors. All are supported by a firm, tannic texture that is rounded out by a sensation of richness.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There is a lovely, poised balance between fresh, crisp fruitiness and peppered spice in this wine made from the increasingly rare Chasselas. It is light, flavored with apple and quince, very attractive and ready to drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The wine is rich, full in the mouth and delicious. With its creamy texture, baked apple flavors and sprinkling of spice, it's a dense and ripe wine that could be drunk now, but which will be better in 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe berry, tilled earth, violet, grilled herb and coffee aromas lead the nose on this firmly structured wine. The palate delivers black cherry, crushed raspberry, chocolate, anisette and black pepper. It's supported by a backbone of bracing, astringent tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Concentrated and generous in sweet red fruit, this is a gangbuster Oakville Merlot for the price. Balanced in fruit, herb and dry tannin, it's a lovable quaff from a well-known vineyard.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Restrained in new oak, this refined wine has a floral honeysuckle character that's followed by hearty, rich layers of apple and melon. Just a touch of licorice and orange zest appears on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very well structured and richly textured, this is a serious red for a special occasion. It has a deep, smoky red color, slightly herbaceous and mineral aromas, generous cherry and raspberry flavors, full body and lots of fine tannins to give a soft bite on the palate. Made from 50% Tinta Roriz, 35% Carmenère, 15% Cabernet Franc.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This structured Barbaresco offers aromas of ripe black fruit, espresso and balsamic notes. The fleshy palate delivers crushed black cherry, licorice, coffee bean, black pepper and grilled herb alongside grippy tannins that need a few years to soften and unwind. Drink after 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh, crisp and uncomplicated, this offers aromas of honey and sliced peaches, with a lively texture and good balance. Medium-bodied, it makes a great wine for a picnic, before dinner or with seafood.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With its ripe and perfumed character, the wine is not quite dry. It's already maturing, with its fruity acidity muted by almonds, ripe pear skins and a tight, mineral texture. This intense wine will be ready by 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This exotic and memorable white wine brings a floral, perfumed aroma, ripe fruit flavors and a nicely viscous texture. Rather light in body for its richness level, it delivers a lingering finish. It has the generous texture of a Chardonnay but with more intense fruit flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is an exceptionally young wine, still tight, textured and mineral. The potential shows in the white fruits, lemon crispness and rich background. It's full of both fruit and a firm, steely structure. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Subtle flavors, great balance and some mineral complexity add interest. It is tangy, refreshing and just a bit restrained until the finish, where it opens up and stays with you.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Named after Emile Boeckel's great-grandmother, Clos Eugénie is a parcel of vines on chalky soil, producing this rich, full-bodied wine. A good tranche of minerality gives the wine an edge while the lively fruits and acidity add brightness. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rich and finely balanced, this wine combines spice notes with rich tannins and blackberry tones. While it is dense and complex, it is still young and needs time to age. Drink after 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas include red flower, iris, black fruit, baking spices and a whiff of eucalyptus. On the palate, cinnamon, sage, mint and a hint of vanilla add depth to the sour cherry and black raspberry flavors. It's still young with tight, drying tannins that need time to unwind. Drink 2016–2021.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This full-bodied wine reveals aromas of wild berry and allspice accented with a balsamic note. The palate is still rather closed but delivers black cherry, black pepper, sage and licorice alongside tightly woven tannins that need to unwind. Drink 2016–2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Mature black fruit, leather, wild berries and balsamic notes waft out of the glass. The solid palate delivers red cherry, toast and a whiff of orange peel alongside bracing tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a firm wine with ripe Merlot fruits that are still sheathed in tannins. Densely textured, it is rich with berries and a stalky character that needs to soften. Wait for this solid, concentrated and ageworthy wine until 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bold boysenberry flavors and a broad, juicy texture make this full-bodied wine appealing and easy to enjoy. The texture is moderately tannic and everything tastes well proportioned.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sémillon (60%) makes up the majority of this blend followed by Sauvignon Blanc (22%) and Muscadelle. The aromas of wet stone, lees, orange rind and fresh flowers are light and elusive. The palate brings a sense of elegance and balance.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh and bright aromas of blackberry pastry and black-cherry fruit show on the nose of this wine from a longtime Paso producer. There are tart tannins on the palate, with red-cherry flavors enhanced by turned black earth, dried mint and dill.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of sugared plums, herbs and black currants lead to black- and blue-fruit flavors that are surprisingly soft. One misses the tannins Cabernet is known for but it makes up for it elsewhere.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This garnet-colored wine made from 100% Kallmet has aromas of black cherry, black pepper and red plums. It has flavors of red raspberry, cinnamon and red plums. The tannins are soft and round and the finish is persistent.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bold, penetrating tannins and bright cranberry acidity lend a tight frame to this classically styled Blaufränkisch, a.k.a. Lemberger. Crisp-tart blackberry and blueberry flavors are accented by bramble and herb notes that linger long on the finish. Its quite closed now, but should show well after 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This cherry-colored wine offers the nose baking spice, tart cherry and black peppercorns. It has a medium body with nice minerality and flavors of blueberry jam, tart cherries and dried violets.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Leathery olive aromas are not overly ripe or fruity. This is Graciano, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon from southerly Cádiz, and it's tight and narrow in mouthfeel, with roasted, stalky berry flavors. A full, grabby finish tastes more savory and spicy than fruity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fig and fennel star in this block-designated white that is crisp and fresh around a medium-strength body. Ready for the table, it finishes quick and clean.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend is 74% Merlot, 14% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petit Verdot. Locked up vanilla, herb and dark fruit aromas lead to high-octane dark-fruit flavors, with the heat providing some distraction.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Salted peach, hints of dried banana and wisps of smoke show on the rather light and restrained nose of this bottling by Eli Parker and winemaker Blair Fox. The palate plays on acid-driven minerality and the grippy textural side of the grapes, with flavors of yellow apple, ripe nectarine, sea salt and mandarin orange.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raspberry jam, prune, cake spice and grilled herb aromas unfold on this full-bodied wine. The palate is already rather evolved, offering dried black cherry, fig, anise and tobacco alongside mature tannins that lead to a tongue-drying finish. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blueberry, vanilla and caramel pop on the nose of this wine from the pioneering brand that is now owned by Bill Foley. Soft yet dense tannins and a plush mouthfeel ensue once sipped, with elderberry, bay leaf and fresh herbs showing on the tightly structured palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sharp aromas of jasmine, green-apple rind and crisp pear flesh give a greener twist to the nose of this bottling by the sHearst family. The palate is framed by tangy, pinpoint acidity, showing lime rind, Anjou pear and squeezed orange flavors that leave the tongue tingling.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Truffle, underbrush, blackberry compote and an earthy whiff of game emerge on this hearty red. The warm, rather evolved palate doles out mature black cherry, licorice, clove and leather alongside solid tannins that grip the finish. It's one-dimensional and overtly ripe.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a soft wine, full of ripe apple and white currant fruit flavors. It's fresh , but also has a steely edge that gives a strong texture. Produced from chalk and clay soils, it is tight, rich and needs a few months more in bottle. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An perfumed wine, this is light and fruity. Bright raspberry flavors are lifted by refreshing acidity and a tang of zesty lemon. A touch of minerality gives texture. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Ripe plum, game, truffle, leather and menthol are some of the aromas you'll find on this earthy wine. The tightly wound palate offers dried black cherry, chopped sage, mint and roasted coffee bean alongside raspy tannins that leave a mouth-drying finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Oak, coconut, toast, espresso, menthol and a whiff of cellar floor are some of the aromas you'll find on this robust red. The big, warm palate offers raisin, date, licorice and roasted coffee bean. Teeth-coating tannins leave an astringent finish while the heat of evident alcohol throws it off-balance. While it's tightly tannic, there's not much fruit richness, making this more suited for mid-term drinking.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy aromas of game, porcini mushroom, scorched earth, saline and crushed herb meld together on this. The taut palate offers raw red berry, mineral and grilled sage alongside austere tannins. Drink 2018–2023.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Oaky aromas of milk chocolate and animal sit atop plum and cherry scents. This is a direct wine without a lot of nuance or layering: flavors of red plum and cherry are crisp and benefit from chocolaty oak, while the finish is solid in feel and tastes of oak and briny plum.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from 35% Obeidi, an indigenous grape usually reserved for Arak production, 35% Clairette, 15% Sauvignon Blanc and 15% Chardonnay, this wine is medium straw in the glass and has a nose of peach, Turkish delight and lilac. It is full in the mouth, offering flavors of ripe summer peach, rose petal and eucalyptus. The final moments are punctuated by a delightful blend of soft peach and strong mint flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The texture and structure of this wine may be light but the fruitiness is so appealing. Soft and ripe with red-berry fruit flavors and refreshing acidity, it will develop quickly and be ready to drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine is two-thirds Syrah with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese. Reticent aromas of vanilla, woodspice, cigar box and plum lead to elegantly styled fruit and barrel flavors that trail toward the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From vines that sit at 1,000 feet overlooking Monterey and the Carmel Valley, this wine only went through partial malolactic fermentation. It shows a tight nose of lemon-laced sour cream and grapefruit blossoms. Lime peels, more sour cream and stronger grapefruit-pith flavors mark the tight, tart palate that has firmness that will mellow with age.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raspberry, herb and sugared-plum aromas are followed by easy-drinking red-fruit flavors that show a sense of balance that keeps the interest high.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Merlot and Cabernet Franc make up the majority of this blend. The aromas of dried herbs, pencil lead, cherry and spice are subdued while the palate brings a somewhat elegant style, with the tannins seeming a bit bunched up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Essentially this is a rosé of Merlot, with just 5% Muscat blended in. Strawberry and watermelon fruit is light and lively, with an undercurrent of orange juice, perhaps from that Muscat. Merlot-based rosés tend to fall a bit on the tannic side, which here adds grip to the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A nose of black cherry, cocoa and juniper berry paves the way for flavors of tart cherry, white chocolate, cocoa and orange zest. Bright fruit compensates for strong tannins, and although there is a cranberry burst towards, the finish tannins remain on the lips and tongue.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A unique offering of the variety, this wine displays aromas of fresh and dried tobacco, allspice, smoke and blue fruit. The plum flavors are sweet and supple, showing good concentration with a mesquite-filled finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Light and almost effervescent in the glass, this popular Grenache-based pink from Doug Margerum offers yeasty, Champagne-like aromas, soft lemon-peel scents and wet slate minerality. The palate's tingling acidity delivers chalky lime and cotton candy flavors, bound together with compelling tension.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A wonderfully herbal lift of mint precedes ripe cherry fruit on the nose of this wine. The palate brims with lusciously ripe plum, while supple tannins provide a velvety but firm background against which the mellow fruit can play. It's fresh, juicy and full-bodied.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "With a high proportion of Mourvèdre in the blend, the wine is structured and finely perfumed. It has some firm tannins that are well integrated into the red-berries. While the wine is richly textured, it is also bursting with fruit at the end. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A concentrated, medium-bodied wine, this is a fine example of Marlborough and the variety. Hints of passion fruit lend regional typicity, while the core of the wine is built around white grapefruit flavors that finish long and mouthwatering.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of pencil shavings, Band-Aid, prune and black plum are good but shy. This Cabernet feels jammy but also a touch rough and tannic. Blackberry, toast, charred wood, salt and savory plum flavors finish solid but not complex or unique.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wonderfully smooth and layered, this medium-bodied wine smells like fresh berries, tastes fruity and mildly spicy and feels silky in the mouth. The components are beautifully balanced, as fresh acidity lifts the fruitiness and mild tannins add a velvety touch.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An appellation wine that's affordable and instantly likable, this has strong forest and mushroom elements, seeming at once rustic and sophisticated. Cranberry and orange tones add brightness to the savory character, framed by fine tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Briny cidery aromas are fortunately not that loud or intense. This is wide and generous on the palate, with dry briny stone-fruit and apple flavors. A sense of dryness and pickle brine is amplified on a purposeful finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Wood resin, green melon and a slight whiff of gasoline comprise the nose on this fresh refined manzanilla. Spiced apple, sea salt and sautéed white mushroom flavors are lasting on a healthy semicomplex finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dark cherry and black licorice flavors combine in this wine from a 1,650-feet-elevation, estate-grown site. Moderate acidity buoys the fruit's ripeness and concentration, structured with firm, tight tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A dry style with just enough acid to lend focus and length, this is a fine effort from Simon Waghorn, the owner-winemaker. Hints of baking spices and ginger lend nuance to the apple, pear, melon and citrus fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "For an entry level wine, this is impressive, offering hints of grapefruit pith, bergamot and smoke on the nose and following those up with some meaty-mushroomy notes on the palate. It's not typical, but boasts a silky texture and a unqieu combination of citrus and umami that lingers nicely on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Admirably concentrated and complex, this is a medium- to full-bodied wine. Passion fruit and snap pea notes combine with citrus zest on the nose, palate and long, mouthwatering finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is zippy and refreshing, offering aromas of struck flint, pea shoots and grapefruit. For its abv, it's light on the palate, dancing with vibrant grass and citrus flavors and crisp acids.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Exotically fruity with an enticing floral character, this full-bodied, almost-sweet wine has lots to appreciate. It starts with a complex bouquet of black currant, cedar and ripe black cherry and continues on the palate with ripeness and concentration, without a lot of tannin.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Coral in color, this dry wine's light, fresh watermelon aromas lead to tasty raspberry and cherry flavors, backed by bright acidity. It's medium bodied and mouth-filling, maintaining a refreshing, appetizing quality through the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The nose promises ripe, red cherry fruit and the palate delivers with a sprightly, bouncy, juicy red that's full of freshness. Wonderfully unpretentious fruit shines, with a little pepper spice to liven things up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tangy boysenberry and elderberry fruit shows on the nose of this sultry bottling, along with thyme, potpourri and licorice. The flavors are more cooked than fresh, recalling charred blackberry, dried blueberry, leather and licorice. It's a hearty wine that consumes the entire palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This pink stands out for its Ruby Red grapefruit aromas, backed by touches of orange peel and chalk. The mouthfeel is grippy and energetic, recalling again a grapefruit's juice and pith. A perfect breakfast wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This blend of 42% Grenache, 37% Mourvèdre, 16% Syrah and 5% Petite Sirah offers plum and mulberry aromas, with touches of thyme and sage. The palate delivers a similar range of dried fruit and wild herb flavors, showing dark strawberry and plenty of savory garrigue.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The vineyard is on the slopes of the Massif des Maures, on the way to Saint-Tropez. This special cuvée is ripe and full in the mouth. It has a bone-dry texture, balancing fruit and spice. This serious wine will be ready from late 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a screaming deal for such an admirably good wine, blended with smaller amounts of Petite Sirah and Syrah. Compressed black fruit meets fresh leather on the perfumed nose. The palate follows with thick tannins and mouthcoating flavors of licorice and cinnamon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The Fillippini family has been growing grapes in eastern Paso Robles since 1982, and this is among their better modern bottlings. The nose offers light sandalwood, ripe cranberry and river stone mineral scents. Its punchy berry fruit is underlaid with leather and cigar accents on the palate, where buoyant acidity and grippy tannic structure pervades.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cabernet Sauvignon makes up half of this wine, with the balance Merlot (31%), Malbec (15%) and Cabernet Franc. Barrel notes of vanilla and baking spice are up front, followed by herb and dark fruit tones that are backed by lively acidity. It currently drinks very tight. Give it some time in the cellar or an extended decant. Best after 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Distinct dried pear, apricot and sultana notes signal some evolution in this wine. The same, rich dried fruit notes are accented with zesty grapefruit freshness on the dry, concentrated palate. It finishes with pithy bitterness and a moreish streak of lemon. Rather advanced for the vintage but still evolving. Drink now–2022.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine leads with the fruity scent of fresh Conference and yellow pear. Its slightly spritzy palate comes with some yeasty, herbal savoriness and finishes fresh and dry.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",

      "This traditional method  sparkler opens with a genteel toastiness on the nose and palate. Fresh and bright fruit flavors suggest apples dusted with cinnamon. It's vintage dated and sourced from a single vineyard. Beware when opening–the cork virtually exploded from the bottle as soon as the capsule was loosened!\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Reduced when first opened, this wine shows its lemony, fresh apple notes with a bit of air. It has the lovely midpalate texture and freshness inherent to good Chardonnay and fills the mouth with citrus and orchard fruit notes. Slender, structured and fresh-faced, it only needs some time to breathe.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "An appetizing touch of red currant and cranberry plays on the nose of this vividly colored rosé. The palate is fruit-forward with subtle shades of berry and citrus. The finish is refreshing and berry-laden.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is both fruity and deliciously crisp. It has the light touch of the vintage—red fruits attractively balancing with the acidity and the tangy lemon edge. The aftertaste is both fruity and herbal. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fruit flavors of pineapple and lemon are pushed forward, followed by a pleasing touch of light butter. The wine was barrel fermented in half new, half used oak. It's a fine spring/summer quaffer.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Not as full bodied as the tall bottle might indicate, this is instead a restrained, not-so-ripe wine that has an appetizing dryness, firm tannins and supportive acidity. It smells and tastes like dried cherries and cranberries, with a slightly astringent mouthfeel that will wash down rich foods well.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dried cherries, black slate, brown spice and leather greet the nose on this affordable red from the esteemed regional producer that makes many Zinfandels each vintage. The palate shows black cherries and a plum skin acidity, with some rocky elements providing further intrigue.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Full flavored and full bodied, this big, expansive wine oozes ripe and dried fruit character from the aroma to the flavors and finish. It suggests blackberry and strawberry flavors, feels tannic on the palate rather than soft, and carries a bit of warmth.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Incense, exotic spice and red berries are some of the aromas you'll find on this Sangiovese. The palate offers menthol, coconut, oak extract, coffee and dried cherry alongside assertive, rough-edged tannins that dry out the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Slightly sour and funky in earth, this is a restrained white aged in a majority of stainless steel, in addition to smaller percentages of oak and acacia. Crisp and minerally, marked by stone fruit as well as citrus, it finishes rich in caramel and vanilla.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of red cherry and a whiff of baking spice emerge from this bright blend of 70% Sangiovese, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. The aromas carry over to the fresh, easy-drinking palate along with a crushed raspberry note. Enjoy through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Despite this having a distinctly green nose, there's enough cherry and currant character along with overall brightness to make this an enjoyable Cab. Oaky flavors of vanilla and cream accent cherry and red plum. The finish is oaky yet bolstered by firm acids.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A 50-50 blend of Merlot and Syrah, this easygoing wine opens with aromas of red currant, graphite and cracked peppercorn. The lively palate offers blackberries, blueberries and clove alongside tangy acidity and dusty tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of ripe plum, dark-skinned berry, cedar and purple flowers. The palate delivers prunes, dried black cherries, licorice and black pepper alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh red cherries, strawberries and cranberry greet the nose on this widely available wine that also shows mocha and charred chaparral. The palate is lively and also boasts some decent tannins, offering flavors of plum and pomegranate juice, crushed marjoram and licorice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Bright berry and dark spice aromas waft out of the glass. A blend of Sangiovese and Syrah, the easy-drinking palate delivers blackberries, crushed raspberries and ground pepper alongside polished tannins. Drink soon.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A strong vein of oak smoke and brown sugar runs from the aroma to the finish in this full-bodied, extroverted wine. The flavors resemble ripe blackberry, cocoa and sweet coffee, while the tannins give it a nip of astringency that will be great with big juicy servings of meat.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Auxerrois, a grape variety rarely seen in the United States, shows it's fresh white grapefruit and pear flavors well in this brisk, revitalizing wine. Dry in style, it's a zesty, straightforward wine intended for early consumption.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sunny tangerine acidity and white peach flavors brighten this earthy, smoky Riesling. Off dry, brisk and finely textured, it's a refreshing, yet juicy sip. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tart and sweet, zesty and ripe, this off-dry Riesling bursts with bright apple and yellow peach flavors. A faint wisp of smoke and minerals lend some gravitas to this otherwise easy quaffer. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raspberry and red-plum aromas are floral and fresh, but simple. This has a hard, almost metallic mouthfeel and red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry. A wiry, short finish is raw and snappy in feel, with a hint of oak.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made entirely of the Alpine grape Prié Blanc, planted in the highest vineyards in Europe, this vibrant sparkler opens with aromas of green apple, white spring flowers and a hint of resin. The palate offers ripe Bartlett pear, creamy Granny Smith and Alpine herb alongside brisk acidity and persistent bubbles.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blossomy and fresh, this off-dry, light-footed Riesling offers a palate full of sweet-tart white-grapefruit flavor. Zesty and spry, it's a refreshing apéritif best enjoyed young.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This ripe and rich wine has firm tannins and a smooth texture, making it a tasty match for rich protein dishes. It packs plump blackberry and juicy boysenberry flavors in a blend that tastes just slightly sweet, coating the palate and lingering on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Dusty mineral and white blossoms perfume this off-dry Scheurebe. It's ethereally light in body, but white grapefruit flavor penetrates the palate. Finishes crisp and dry.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Cherry and olive aromas are fair and sound, with a minty green touch. This offers a chunky, full palate and oaky, spicy flavors of black plum. The dark, toasty finish is solid, with kick and mild heat.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Earthy, dry and leathery on the nose, with slightly briny red-fruit aromas, this meets all the requirements of very good everyday Pinot Noir. Tea, brandied black cherry, spice and oak flavors darken up and turn chocolaty on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A heavy bottle holds a wine that's dark gold in color and exuberant in lemon curd and vanilla. Surprisingly light on the palate, given the color, it has a relatively low oak presence and layered, caramel-apple finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Red plum and currant aromas are a touch soupy but also suggestive of cherry Kool-Aid. This Garnacha-led blend is clacky and fairly acidic on the palate, but then it turns on itself to show raisin, loam and baked plum flavors. A lively finish gives it a boost out the door.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made exclusively with Merlot, this opens with aromas of cedar, mint and dark berry. The straightforward palate offers dried black cherry, espresso and a hint of grilled bell pepper alongside somewhat raspy tannins that cut off the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Very fresh and refreshing aromas of honeysuckle blossoms, seared apple, lemongrass and kiwi hit the nose on this wine by James Ontiveros. The palate shows a bit of ripe apple flesh, but trends more toward sour citrus rinds. It's a very clean, crisp wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made solely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of roasted coffee beans, toasted oak and blackberry jam. The warm, jammy palate offers black cherry extract, licorice, clove and black pepper alongside massively stringent tannins that leave the palate feeling roughed up and dry.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Here's an easygoing blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Merlot that offers blue flowers and red berry aromas that carry over to the palate along with a hint of white pepper. Supple tannins support the bright, juicy flavors. Drink through 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "For its youth, this is a rich, smooth wine. The tannins, even from the Malbec in the blend, are full, rounded and already integrated. Acidity and an attractive smokiness give this wine its already-drinkable character. Drink from the end of 2015.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Rustic leathery aromas are capped and low on vibrant fruit scents. In the mouth, expect tannic scratchiness. Flavors of plum, cassis and toasty oak come across as mildly baked, while a narrow finish with notes of earth, loam and chocolate is solid. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Raisin and prune aromas indicate full ripeness, while jammy fig notes come in later and confirm this wine's warm-vintage DNA. A clampy palate with big tannins offers inky flavors of plum and prune, while an oaky concentrated finish feels jammy. Drink through 2018.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Tropical fruit aromas are suggestive of bath soap and body oil. This feels obtuse, with depth and an oily sensation to the palate. Chunky, ripe, oily flavors of melon and orange finish loud and ripe, with a deeper set of tropical fruit flavors than your average Argentine Torrontés.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a pretty, light-copper hue, from a small percentage of the grapes being kept on the skins. Fruity flavors of pear and apple dominate, while the acids conjure up suggestions of orange juice.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Sourced from 35-year-old Wente clone vines, this offers bright apple with hints of peach. It's medium bodied and streaked with flavors of caramel and butterfinger candy.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a blend from Aÿ on the Montagne de Reims and from the Côte des Blancs. It is intensely perfumed, with weight from Pinot Noir and crispness from Chardonnay. If it seems not quite integrated at this stage, it will hopefully come together over the next few years to reveal a ripe and rich wine. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "As its name implies, the wine comes from chalky soil, giving this wine its mineral edge. The fruit is ripe and tropical in its generosity, full of yellow fruits, pineapple and mango. There is a fine floral aroma which, along with acidity, give the wine a bright aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Offering fine flavor for the price, this release emphasizes spice over fruit, with a sharp, slightly herbal edge. Crisp apple and pear show ginger highlights. Drink this lightly chilled with some spicy Thai food.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A streak of wax and honeycomb glazes through this otherwise brisk citrusy Riesling. Off-dry and concentrated in apples and tangerines, it finishes moderately long with lingering touches of tea leaf and honey. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Plum and berry aromas are infiltrated by touches of leafy green and leather on the nose of this texturally sound, herbal-tasting Malbec. Flavors of plum and spice are a touch weedy, while baking spice and clove notes take over on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a rich wine dominated by ripe Alicante Bouschet that gives some firm tannins as well as juicy red berry fruits. It is ripe, well balanced and likely to age well over the next few years. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "A ripe and warm wine full of yellow fruits and a full-bodied texture. It's rich and creamy with a fine balance between exotic fruit and the crispest citrus. The wine is ready to drink.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Unoaked, and instead fermented for 10 months in both stainless steel and concrete egg, this white remains light-bodied and crisp, touched by aromas of honeysuckle and refreshing flavors of pear and quince.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Honeyed red-apple slices, ripe papaya, honeysuckle and honeydew aromas are nicely cut by wet-cement minerality on this nose of this 71% Viognier and 29% Roussanne blend. It's tight and reserved on the palate, tart with lime and apple-juice flavors.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Leesy white fruit aromas open this blend of 80% Albariño with Loureiro and Treixadura. In the mouth, it's all citric acidity and stoniness. The body doesn't register. Flavors of blood orange and lemon are also minerally, while the finish is persistently linear.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Blending Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot and Syrah, RTW is somewhat classical in its black olive and dried herb, yet also rich and concentrated, with tannic bite and a taste of clove. It finishes like vanilla cola.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This cuvée reflects the lean vintage with modest alcohol and slightly dilute fruit flavors. Pretty aromatics suggest rosewater and sandalwood, and the wine fades gracefully with plum and cherry fruit.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Leathery stalky berry aromas come across as being baked and rough. This is full and grabby on the palate with cooked blackberry and prune flavors that end dark, and spicy with notes of licorice and herbs.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of baked plum, spirits, baking spice and a whiff of blue flower lead the nose on this robust wine. The hearty palate offers dried black cherry, raw cranberry, leather and licorice alongside firm tannins and racy acidity. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Despite opening with a yellow color and waxy oily peach aromas, this benefits from zesty lemon-like acidity. Flavors of quince and apple are oaky, while effusive acidity keeps this Verdejo fresh on the finish, which is otherwise big and full. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of black cherries marinated in spirits, menthol, leather and chopped herbs lead the nose on this brawny wine. The hefty palate shows the heat of the vintage, offering dried berries, licorice, tobacco and mocha alongside the warmth of evident alcohol and jarring tannins. Give it a few years to let the tannins soften up a bit but then drink before the fruit dries up.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The chalk subsoil of the Bélingard estate gives this wine its textured character. The wood aging smoothes out the crisp acidity of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon and adds a light layer of toast. It is still a young wine and will be better from late 2016 or even 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh and savory, this opens with aromas of dark berry, ground cooking spice and whiff of chopped herb. The vibrant palate doles out juicy black cherry, clove, star anise and blood orange accompanied by racy acidity.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Spiced blueberry, ripe plum and tilled earth aromas lead the nose on this hearty wine. Made with no added sulfites, the big, chewy palate delivers juicy black cherry, ripe blackberry and licorice alongside the warmth of evident alcohol.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This opens with rather funky aromas of scorched earth, overripe black-skinned fruit and a whiff of barnyard. The extracted palate offers mature black cherry, toast, espresso and a gamey note alongside tightly packed tannins. A note of roasted coffee bean signals the close.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Pretty scents and flavors of bright cherry fruit come up quickly, with enough concentration to batten down a medium-long finish. A light hint of sweat or animal comes up also.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This medium-bodied red opens with aromas of toasted oak, mature berry and freshly brewed coffee. The tight palate offers dried black cherry, white pepper, espresso, and a hint of licorice framed in fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From vines planted to the west of Chablis, this is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. It has some tension from the minerality while keeping the white fruit flavors to the fore. Drink now or, better, from late 2016.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Made from old vines, this ripe and concentrated wine is smooth and creamy. Good acidity balances the rich fruits, giving flavors of apples, pears and apricots cut by a line of citrus. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Luscious peach and blossom notes perfume this plucky off-dry Riesling. Laced with honey and tart tangerine acidity, it's easy, fresh and approachable. Drink now.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This is a tough wine, packed more with tannins than fruit. A bitter chocolate character comes from over-extraction of the tannins. The fruit is slow in coming, although there are hints of juiciness. Give it until 2017.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The 56 acres of this estate are in the heart of the Entre deux Mers region. This young and fruity wine has stalky black currant fruits and fresh acidity. There's a light touch of spicy wood and a crisp, red fruit aftertaste.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This lean wine lacks fruit to support the dry tannins. That probably comes from the extraction that has also caused some bitterness. It's a hard wine that needs time to soften.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "From one of two properties in Listrac owned by the Thomas family (the other is Reverdi), this is seriously dark and tannic, with flavors of bitter chocolate extract and wood. It doesn't feel as if it will really soften enough.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas jump between ripe plum and a dark earthy character, from graphite to wet slate. There is a quite a lot of zing on the palate, perhaps even a touch of carbonation, with flavors of cola and sassafras settling on a blackberry-juice backbone.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Moderately aromatic, this offers notes of red apple, jasmine, and peach. It drinks off dry leaning toward medium sweet, with abundant peach flavors with a creamy feel. It needs a bit more acidity to hold it all together.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This moderately aromatic wine offers notes of herbs, peach and soda water. It's medium sweet with lightly spritzy fruit flavors that have an herbal tinge.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Merlot (48%) takes the lead with no other variety making up more than 18% (Syrah) of the blend. It provides notes of bell pepper, dry chocolate, tire rubber and cherry. The feel is plush but with a sharp note running down the middle that distracts.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Fresh tangerine and orange blossom notes mingle with slightly yeasty, leesy aromas on this otherwise refreshing wine. It's dry in style with bright lime acidity and a lively finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "The gravel soils of the 51-acre vineyard gives this wine its firm character as well as bringing out the fruitiness. While the wood-aging flavors are still strong, this will soften and round out soon for a fresh, fruity wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "There's a definitely alkalinity emerging from the Rhône whites on this vineyard west of Gilroy, this one showing chalk along with dried honey. Waxy apple-skin flavors dominate the palate.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Smoke, dried reed and herb tones persist throughout this earthy, semidry Riesling. Pressed apple and pear flavors are savory as well, but brightened by a shower of tart tangerine acidity on the finish.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Candied cherry and red-plum aromas precede an edgy palate and herbal flavors of plum and berry that are slightly hot and spicy. Raspberry and red-currant flavors on the finish are dilute.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Aromas of roadside brush, field greens and raspberry are suggestive of fruit punch. The palate is full but somewhat cloying, while jammy red-fruit flavors come with a green note. The finish is jammy like the palate, with a pronounced chocolaty oak flavor.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This light and refreshing SB offers mild apple and citrus aromas, a snappy, citric palate and basic flavors of green apple and lime. As a whole, it's a cleansing but fairly standard wine.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This easy-drinking, value-minded wine offers notes of plum, tobacco, bell pepper and green herbs, with a vanilla top note. It's straightforward in style, with clunky tannins.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Peach and powdered sugar aromas are first up, followed by a round palate with oily weight but also zesty acidity. Racy citrus and nectarine flavors finish full and chunky, with a pithy note.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Simple cherry and plum aromas lead to a modest palate with little substance to it. Short bursts of red-fruit flavors are as basic as can be, while the finish is hollow but raw in feel.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This 100% varietal wine is lightly aromatic with peach, almond and pumpkin. It's cleanly made but the flavors seem dilute.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "This wine offers intriguing notes of peach, mango and spice. It's lighter in style with just off-dry fruit flavors that linger.\n",
