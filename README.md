1. Our goal with this project was to create a wine recommendation engine based on certain attributes of each wine. Attributes used included place of origin; 'country,' 'province/state, & 'winery.' Other attributes included the number of 'points' assigned to each wine by professional reviewers at Wine Enthusiast magazine, the variety of wine, and the price of a bottle.

2. We used several linear regression Machine Learning models to predict the prices of those wines who did not have a bottle price included in the data.

    2a. These models are found in the 'wine_predict_df' notebook

3. We also used NLP to analyze the descriptions of each wine's tastes as provided in the data in order to recommend a wine that would be suited to one's tastes based on their input into our recommendation engine.
